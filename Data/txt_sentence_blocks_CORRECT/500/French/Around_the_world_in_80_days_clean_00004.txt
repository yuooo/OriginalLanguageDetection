He found himself , then , about twenty-four hours behind-hand , thirty-five days after leaving London . 
The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next morning . 
Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there , which was to deposit Aouda safely with her wealthy relative . 
On landing , he conducted her to a palanquin , in which they repaired to the Club Hotel . 
A room was engaged for the young woman , and Mr. Fogg , after seeing that she wanted for nothing , set out in search of her cousin Jeejeeh . 
He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return , that Aouda might not be left entirely alone . 
Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange , where , he did not doubt , every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee merchant . 
Meeting a broker , he made the inquiry , to learn that Jeejeeh had left China two years before , and , retiring from business with an immense fortune , had taken up his residence in Europe -- in Holland the broker thought , with the merchants of which country he had principally traded . 
Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel , begged a moment 's conversation with Aouda , and without more ado , apprised her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong , but probably in Holland . 
Aouda at first said nothing . 
She passed her hand across her forehead , and reflected a few moments . 
Then , in her sweet , soft voice , she said : `` What ought I to do , Mr. Fogg ? '' 
`` It is very simple , '' responded the gentleman . 
`` Go on to Europe . '' 
`` But I can not intrude -- '' `` You do not intrude , nor do you in the least embarrass my project . 
Passepartout ! '' 
`` Monsieur . '' 
`` Go to the Carnatic , and engage three cabins . '' 
Passepartout , delighted that the young woman , who was very gracious to him , was going to continue the journey with them , went off at a brisk gait to obey his master 's order . 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TAKES A TOO GREAT INTEREST IN HIS MASTER , AND WHAT COMES OF IT Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by the Treaty of Nankin , after the war of 1842 ; and the colonising genius of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port . 
The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River , and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao , on the opposite coast . 
Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade , and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place . 
Docks , hospitals , wharves , a Gothic cathedral , a government house , macadamised streets , give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes . 
Passepartout wandered , with his hands in his pockets , towards the Victoria port , gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance , and the groups of Chinese , Japanese , and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets . 
Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay , Calcutta , and Singapore , since , like them , it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy . 
At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations : English , French , American , and Dutch , men-of-war and trading vessels , Japanese and Chinese junks , sempas , tankas , and flower-boats , which formed so many floating parterres . 
Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow . 
On going into a barber 's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old , at which age they are permitted to wear yellow , which is the Imperial colour . 
Passepartout , without exactly knowing why , thought this very funny . 
On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic , he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down . 
The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed . 
`` This is bad , '' muttered Passepartout , `` for the gentlemen of the Reform Club ! '' 
He accosted Fix with a merry smile , as if he had not perceived that gentleman 's chagrin . 
The detective had , indeed , good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him . 
The warrant had not come ! 
It was certainly on the way , but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for several days ; and , this being the last English territory on Mr. Fogg 's route , the robber would escape , unless he could manage to detain him . 
`` Well , Monsieur Fix , '' said Passepartout , `` have you decided to go with us so far as America ? '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Fix , through his set teeth . 
`` Good ! '' 
exclaimed Passepartout , laughing heartily . 
`` I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us . 
Come and engage your berth . '' 
They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons . 
The clerk , as he gave them the tickets , informed them that , the repairs on the Carnatic having been completed , the steamer would leave that very evening , and not next morning , as had been announced . 
`` That will suit my master all the better , '' said Passepartout . 
`` I will go and let him know . '' 
Fix now decided to make a bold move ; he resolved to tell Passepartout all . 
It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong . 
He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay . 
On entering , they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated , at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions . 
Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep . 
At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer , porter , gin , and brandy ; smoking , the while , long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose . 
From time to time one of the smokers , overcome with the narcotic , would slip under the table , whereupon the waiters , taking him by the head and feet , carried and laid him upon the bed . 
The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots . 
Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched , cadaverous , idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium , to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds -- thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity ! 
The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws . 
It passed gradually from the rich , to whom it was at first exclusively reserved , to the lower classes , and then its ravages could not be arrested . 
Opium is smoked everywhere , at all times , by men and women , in the Celestial Empire ; and , once accustomed to it , the victims can not dispense with it , except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies . 
A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day ; but he dies in five years . 
It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout , in search of a friendly glass , found themselves . 
Passepartout had no money , but willingly accepted Fix 's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time . 
They ordered two bottles of port , to which the Frenchman did ample justice , whilst Fix observed him with close attention . 
They chatted about the journey , and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them . 
When the bottles were empty , however , he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the Carnatic . 
Fix caught him by the arm , and said , `` Wait a moment . '' 
`` What for , Mr. Fix ? '' 
`` I want to have a serious talk with you . '' 
`` A serious talk ! '' 
cried Passepartout , drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass . 
`` Well , we 'll talk about it to-morrow ; I have n't time now . '' 
`` Stay ! 
What I have to say concerns your master . '' 
Passepartout , at this , looked attentively at his companion . 
Fix 's face seemed to have a singular expression . 
He resumed his seat . 
`` What is it that you have to say ? '' 
Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout 's arm , and , lowering his voice , said , `` You have guessed who I am ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
said Passepartout , smiling . 
`` Then I 'm going to tell you everything -- '' `` Now that I know everything , my friend ! 
Ah ! 
that 's very good . 
But go on , go on . 
First , though , let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense . '' 
`` Useless ! '' 
said Fix . 
`` You speak confidently . 
It 's clear that you do n't know how large the sum is . '' 
`` Of course I do , '' returned Passepartout . 
`` Twenty thousand pounds . '' 
`` Fifty-five thousand ! '' 
answered Fix , pressing his companion 's hand . 
`` What ! '' 
cried the Frenchman . 
`` Has Monsieur Fogg dared -- fifty-five thousand pounds ! 
Well , there 's all the more reason for not losing an instant , '' he continued , getting up hastily . 
Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair , and resumed : `` Fifty-five thousand pounds ; and if I succeed , I get two thousand pounds . 
If you 'll help me , I 'll let you have five hundred of them . '' 
`` Help you ? '' 
cried Passepartout , whose eyes were standing wide open . 
`` Yes ; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days . '' 
`` Why , what are you saying ? 
Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour , but they must try to put obstacles in his way ! 
I blush for them ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery . 
They might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets ! '' 
`` That 's just what we count on doing . '' 
`` It 's a conspiracy , then , '' cried Passepartout , who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head , for he drank without perceiving it . 
`` A real conspiracy ! 
And gentlemen , too . 
Bah ! '' 
Fix began to be puzzled . 
`` Members of the Reform Club ! '' 
continued Passepartout . 
`` You must know , Monsieur Fix , that my master is an honest man , and that , when he makes a wager , he tries to win it fairly ! '' 
`` But who do you think I am ? '' 
asked Fix , looking at him intently . 
`` Parbleu ! 
An agent of the members of the Reform Club , sent out here to interrupt my master 's journey . 
But , though I found you out some time ago , I 've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg . '' 
`` He knows nothing , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' replied Passepartout , again emptying his glass . 
The detective passed his hand across his forehead , hesitating before he spoke again . 
What should he do ? 
Passepartout 's mistake seemed sincere , but it made his design more difficult . 
It was evident that the servant was not the master 's accomplice , as Fix had been inclined to suspect . 
`` Well , '' said the detective to himself , `` as he is not an accomplice , he will help me . '' 
He had no time to lose : Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong , so he resolved to make a clean breast of it . 
`` Listen to me , '' said Fix abruptly . 
`` I am not , as you think , an agent of the members of the Reform Club -- '' `` Bah ! '' 
retorted Passepartout , with an air of raillery . 
`` I am a police detective , sent out here by the London office . '' 
`` You , a detective ? '' 
`` I will prove it . 
Here is my commission . '' 
Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document , the genuineness of which could not be doubted . 
`` Mr. Fogg 's wager , '' resumed Fix , `` is only a pretext , of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes . 
He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity . '' 
`` But why ? '' 
`` Listen . 
On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured . 
Here is his description ; it answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg . '' 
`` What nonsense ! '' 
cried Passepartout , striking the table with his fist . 
`` My master is the most honourable of men ! '' 
`` How can you tell ? 
You know scarcely anything about him . 
You went into his service the day he came away ; and he came away on a foolish pretext , without trunks , and carrying a large amount in banknotes . 
And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' repeated the poor fellow , mechanically . 
`` Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice ? '' 
Passepartout , overcome by what he had heard , held his head between his hands , and did not dare to look at the detective . 
Phileas Fogg , the saviour of Aouda , that brave and generous man , a robber ! 
And yet how many presumptions there were against him ! 
Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind ; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty . 
`` Well , what do you want of me ? '' 
said he , at last , with an effort . 
`` See here , '' replied Fix ; `` I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place , but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to London . 
You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong -- '' `` I ! 
But I -- '' `` I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England . '' 
`` Never ! '' 
replied Passepartout , who tried to rise , but fell back , exhausted in mind and body . 
`` Mr. Fix , '' he stammered , `` even should what you say be true -- if my master is really the robber you are seeking for -- which I deny -- I have been , am , in his service ; I have seen his generosity and goodness ; and I will never betray him -- not for all the gold in the world . 
I come from a village where they do n't eat that kind of bread ! '' 
`` You refuse ? '' 
`` I refuse . '' 
`` Consider that I 've said nothing , '' said Fix ; `` and let us drink . '' 
`` Yes ; let us drink ! '' 
Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor . 
Fix , seeing that he must , at all hazards , be separated from his master , wished to entirely overcome him . 
Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table . 
Fix slipped one into Passepartout 's hand . 
He took it , put it between his lips , lit it , drew several puffs , and his head , becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic , fell upon the table . 
`` At last ! '' 
said Fix , seeing Passepartout unconscious . 
`` Mr. Fogg will not be informed of the Carnatic 's departure ; and , if he is , he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman ! '' 
And , after paying his bill , Fix left the tavern . 
IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG While these events were passing at the opium-house , Mr. Fogg , unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer , was quietly escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter , making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them . 
It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag ; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions . 
He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity , and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion , who was confused by his patience and generosity : `` It is in the interest of my journey -- a part of my programme . '' 
The purchases made , they returned to the hotel , where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote ; after which Aouda , shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion , retired to her room for rest . 
Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News . 
Had he been capable of being astonished at anything , it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime . 
But , knowing that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning , he did not disturb himself about the matter . 
When Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his master 's bell , Mr. Fogg , not betraying the least vexation , contented himself with taking his carpet-bag , calling Aouda , and sending for a palanquin . 
It was then eight o'clock ; at half-past nine , it being then high tide , the Carnatic would leave the harbour . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin , their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow , and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark . 
Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before . 
He had expected to find not only the steamer , but his domestic , and was forced to give up both ; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face , and he merely remarked to Aouda , `` It is an accident , madam ; nothing more . '' 
At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached . 
It was Fix , who , bowing , addressed Mr. Fogg : `` Were you not , like me , sir , a passenger by the Rangoon , which arrived yesterday ? '' 
`` I was , sir , '' replied Mr. Fogg coldly . 
`` But I have not the honour -- '' `` Pardon me ; I thought I should find your servant here . '' 
`` Do you know where he is , sir ? '' 
asked Aouda anxiously . 
`` What ! '' 
responded Fix , feigning surprise . 
`` Is he not with you ? '' 
`` No , '' said Aouda . 
`` He has not made his appearance since yesterday . 
Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us ? '' 
`` Without you , madam ? '' 
answered the detective . 
`` Excuse me , did you intend to sail in the Carnatic ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
`` So did I , madam , and I am excessively disappointed . 
The Carnatic , its repairs being completed , left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time , without any notice being given ; and we must now wait a week for another steamer . '' 
As he said `` a week '' Fix felt his heart leap for joy . 
Fogg detained at Hong Kong for a week ! 
There would be time for the warrant to arrive , and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law . 
His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say , in his placid voice , `` But there are other vessels besides the Carnatic , it seems to me , in the harbour of Hong Kong . '' 
And , offering his arm to Aouda , he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start . 
Fix , stupefied , followed ; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread . 
Chance , however , appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well . 
For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks , with the determination , if necessary , to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama ; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading , and which could not therefore set sail . 
Fix began to hope again . 
But Mr. Fogg , far from being discouraged , was continuing his search , resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao , when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves . 
`` Is your honour looking for a boat ? '' 
`` Have you a boat ready to sail ? '' 
`` Yes , your honour ; a pilot-boat -- No. 43 -- the best in the harbour . '' 
`` Does she go fast ? '' 
`` Between eight and nine knots the hour . 
Will you look at her ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Your honour will be satisfied with her . 
Is it for a sea excursion ? '' 
`` No ; for a voyage . '' 
`` A voyage ? '' 
`` Yes , will you agree to take me to Yokohama ? '' 
The sailor leaned on the railing , opened his eyes wide , and said , `` Is your honour joking ? '' 
`` No . 
I have missed the Carnatic , and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest , to take the boat for San Francisco . '' 
`` I am sorry , '' said the sailor ; `` but it is impossible . '' 
`` I offer you a hundred pounds per day , and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time . '' 
`` Are you in earnest ? '' 
`` Very much so . '' 
The pilot walked away a little distance , and gazed out to sea , evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far . 
Fix was in mortal suspense . 
Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her , `` You would not be afraid , would you , madam ? '' 
`` Not with you , Mr. Fogg , '' was her answer . 
The pilot now returned , shuffling his hat in his hands . 
`` Well , pilot ? '' 
said Mr. Fogg . 
`` Well , your honour , '' replied he , `` I could not risk myself , my men , or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year . 
Besides , we could not reach Yokohama in time , for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong . '' 
`` Only sixteen hundred , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's the same thing . '' 
Fix breathed more freely . 
`` But , '' added the pilot , `` it might be arranged another way . '' 
Fix ceased to breathe at all . 
`` How ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` By going to Nagasaki , at the extreme south of Japan , or even to Shanghai , which is only eight hundred miles from here . 
In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast , which would be a great advantage , as the currents run northward , and would aid us . 
`` Pilot , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` I must take the American steamer at Yokohama , and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
returned the pilot . 
`` The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama . 
It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki , but it starts from Shanghai . '' 
`` You are sure of that ? '' 
`` Perfectly . '' 
`` And when does the boat leave Shanghai ? '' 
`` On the 11th , at seven in the evening . 
We have , therefore , four days before us , that is ninety-six hours ; and in that time , if we had good luck and a south-west wind , and the sea was calm , we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai . '' 
`` And you could go -- '' `` In an hour ; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up . '' 
`` It is a bargain . 
Are you the master of the boat ? '' 
`` Yes ; John Bunsby , master of the Tankadere . '' 
`` Would you like some earnest-money ? '' 
`` If it would not put your honour out -- '' `` Here are two hundred pounds on account sir , '' added Phileas Fogg , turning to Fix , `` if you would like to take advantage -- '' `` Thanks , sir ; I was about to ask the favour . '' 
`` Very well . 
In half an hour we shall go on board . '' 
`` But poor Passepartout ? '' 
urged Aouda , who was much disturbed by the servant 's disappearance . 
`` I shall do all I can to find him , '' replied Phileas Fogg . 
While Fix , in a feverish , nervous state , repaired to the pilot-boat , the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong . 
Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout 's description , and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him . 
The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate , and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage , which had been sent back there , they returned to the wharf . 
It was now three o'clock ; and pilot-boat No. 43 , with its crew on board , and its provisions stored away , was ready for departure . 
The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons , as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht . 
Her shining copper sheathing , her galvanised iron-work , her deck , white as ivory , betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable . 
Her two masts leaned a trifle backward ; she carried brigantine , foresail , storm-jib , and standing-jib , and was well rigged for running before the wind ; and she seemed capable of brisk speed , which , indeed , she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races . 
The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby , the master , and four hardy mariners , who were familiar with the Chinese seas . 
John Bunsby , himself , a man of forty-five or thereabouts , vigorous , sunburnt , with a sprightly expression of the eye , and energetic and self-reliant countenance , would have inspired confidence in the most timid . 
Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board , where they found Fix already installed . 
Below deck was a square cabin , of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots , above a circular divan ; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp . 
The accommodation was confined , but neat . 
`` I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you , '' said Mr. Fogg to Fix , who bowed without responding . 
The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's certain , '' thought he , `` though rascal as he is , he is a polite one ! '' 
The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda , who were seated on deck , cast a last glance at the quay , in the hope of espying Passepartout . 
Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant , whom he had so badly treated , in this direction ; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued . 
But the Frenchman did not appear , and , without doubt , was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium . 
John Bunsby , master , at length gave the order to start , and the Tankadere , taking the wind under her brigantine , foresail , and standing-jib , bounded briskly forward over the waves . 
IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE `` TANKADERE '' RUNS GREAT RISK OF LOSING A REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons , and at that season of the year . 
The Chinese seas are usually boisterous , subject to terrible gales of wind , and especially during the equinoxes ; and it was now early November . 
It would clearly have been to the master 's advantage to carry his passengers to Yokohama , since he was paid a certain sum per day ; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage , and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai . 
But John Bunsby believed in the Tankadere , which rode on the waves like a seagull ; and perhaps he was not wrong . 
Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong Kong , and the Tankadere , impelled by favourable winds , conducted herself admirably . 
`` I do not need , pilot , '' said Phileas Fogg , when they got into the open sea , `` to advise you to use all possible speed . '' 
`` Trust me , your honour . 
We are carrying all the sail the wind will let us . 
The poles would add nothing , and are only used when we are going into port . '' 
`` Its your trade , not mine , pilot , and I confide in you . '' 
Phileas Fogg , with body erect and legs wide apart , standing like a sailor , gazed without staggering at the swelling waters . 
The young woman , who was seated aft , was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean , darkening now with the twilight , on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel . 
Above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings . 
The boat , carried forward by the wind , seemed to be flying in the air . 
Night came . 
The moon was entering her first quarter , and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon . 
Clouds were rising from the east , and already overcast a part of the heavens . 
The pilot had hung out his lights , which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward ; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences , and , at the speed she was going , the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft . 
Fix , seated in the bow , gave himself up to meditation . 
He kept apart from his fellow-travellers , knowing Mr. Fogg 's taciturn tastes ; besides , he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted . 
He was thinking , too , of the future . 
It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama , but would at once take the boat for San Francisco ; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity and safety . 
Fogg 's plan appeared to him the simplest in the world . 
Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States , like a common villain , he had traversed three quarters of the globe , so as to gain the American continent more surely ; and there , after throwing the police off his track , he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank . 
But , once in the United States , what should he , Fix , do ? 
Should he abandon this man ? 
No , a hundred times no ! 
Until he had secured his extradition , he would not lose sight of him for an hour . 
It was his duty , and he would fulfil it to the end . 
At all events , there was one thing to be thankful for ; Passepartout was not with his master ; and it was above all important , after the confidences Fix had imparted to him , that the servant should never have speech with his master . 
Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout , who had so strangely disappeared . 
Looking at the matter from every point of view , it did not seem to him impossible that , by some mistake , the man might have embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment ; and this was also Aouda 's opinion , who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much . 
They might then find him at Yokohama ; for , if the Carnatic was carrying him thither , it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board . 
A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock ; but , though it might have been prudent to take in a reef , the pilot , after carefully examining the heavens , let the craft remain rigged as before . 
The Tankadere bore sail admirably , as she drew a great deal of water , and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight , having been already preceded by Fix , who had lain down on one of the cots . 
The pilot and crew remained on deck all night . 
At sunrise the next day , which was 8th November , the boat had made more than one hundred miles . 
The log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles . 
The Tankadere still carried all sail , and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed . 
If the wind held as it was , the chances would be in her favour . 
During the day she kept along the coast , where the currents were favourable ; the coast , irregular in profile , and visible sometimes across the clearings , was at most five miles distant . 
The sea was less boisterous , since the wind came off land -- a fortunate circumstance for the boat , which would suffer , owing to its small tonnage , by a heavy surge on the sea . 
The breeze subsided a little towards noon , and set in from the south-west . 
The pilot put up his poles , but took them down again within two hours , as the wind freshened up anew . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda , happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea , ate with a good appetite , Fix being invited to share their repast , which he accepted with secret chagrin . 
To travel at this man 's expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him . 
Still , he was obliged to eat , and so he ate . 
When the meal was over , he took Mr. Fogg apart , and said , `` sir '' -- this `` sir '' scorched his lips , and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this `` gentleman '' -- `` sir , you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat . 
But , though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you , I must ask to pay my share -- '' `` Let us not speak of that , sir , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` But , if I insist -- '' `` No , sir , '' repeated Mr. Fogg , in a tone which did not admit of a reply . 
`` This enters into my general expenses . '' 
Fix , as he bowed , had a stifled feeling , and , going forward , where he ensconced himself , did not open his mouth for the rest of the day . 
Meanwhile they were progressing famously , and John Bunsby was in high hope . 
He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai in time ; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it . 
The crew set to work in good earnest , inspired by the reward to be gained . 
There was not a sheet which was not tightened not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted ; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm . 
They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta . 
By evening , the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from Hong Kong , and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal ; in which case , the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left London would not seriously affect his journey . 
The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien , which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast , in the small hours of the night , and crossed the Tropic of Cancer . 
The sea was very rough in the straits , full of eddies formed by the counter-currents , and the chopping waves broke her course , whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck . 
At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again , and the heavens seemed to predict a gale . 
The barometer announced a speedy change , the mercury rising and falling capriciously ; the sea also , in the south-east , raised long surges which indicated a tempest . 
The sun had set the evening before in a red mist , in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean . 
John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens , muttering indistinctly between his teeth . 
At last he said in a low voice to Mr. Fogg , `` Shall I speak out to your honour ? '' 
`` Of course . '' 
`` Well , we are going to have a squall . '' 
`` Is the wind north or south ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg quietly . 
`` South . 
Look ! 
a typhoon is coming up . '' 
`` Glad it 's a typhoon from the south , for it will carry us forward . '' 
`` Oh , if you take it that way , '' said John Bunsby , `` I 've nothing more to say . '' 
John Bunsby 's suspicions were confirmed . 
At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon , according to a famous meteorologist , would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame ; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence . 
The pilot took his precautions in advance . 
He reefed all sail , the pole-masts were dispensed with ; all hands went forward to the bows . 
A single triangular sail , of strong canvas , was hoisted as a storm-jib , so as to hold the wind from behind . 
Then they waited . 
John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below ; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space , with little air , and the boat bouncing in the gale , was far from pleasant . 
Neither Mr. Fogg , Fix , nor Aouda consented to leave the deck . 
The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock . 
With but its bit of sail , the Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind , an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given . 
To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth . 
The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day , borne on by monstrous waves , preserving always , fortunately , a speed equal to theirs . 
Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her ; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her . 
The passengers were often bathed in spray , but they submitted to it philosophically . 
Fix cursed it , no doubt ; but Aouda , with her eyes fastened upon her protector , whose coolness amazed her , showed herself worthy of him , and bravely weathered the storm . 
As for Phileas Fogg , it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme . 
Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to the north ; but towards evening the wind , veering three quarters , bore down from the north-west . 
The boat , now lying in the trough of the waves , shook and rolled terribly ; the sea struck her with fearful violence . 
At night the tempest increased in violence . 
John Bunsby saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings . 
He thought awhile , and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speed . 
After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg , and said , `` I think , your honour , that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast . '' 
`` I think so too . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the pilot . 
`` But which one ? '' 
`` I know of but one , '' returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly . 
`` And that is -- '' `` Shanghai . '' 
The pilot , at first , did not seem to comprehend ; he could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity . 
Then he cried , `` Well -- yes ! 
Your honour is right . 
To Shanghai ! '' 
So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track . 
The night was really terrible ; it would be a miracle if the craft did not founder . 
Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had not been constantly on the watch . 
Aouda was exhausted , but did not utter a complaint . 
More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves . 
Day reappeared . 
The tempest still raged with undiminished fury ; but the wind now returned to the south-east . 
It was a favourable change , and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea , though the waves crossed each other , and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built . 
From time to time the coast was visible through the broken mist , but no vessel was in sight . 
The Tankadere was alone upon the sea . 
There were some signs of a calm at noon , and these became more distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon . 
The tempest had been as brief as terrific . 
The passengers , thoroughly exhausted , could now eat a little , and take some repose . 
The night was comparatively quiet . 
Some of the sails were again hoisted , and the speed of the boat was very good . 
The next morning at dawn they espied the coast , and John Bunsby was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai . 
A hundred miles , and only one day to traverse them ! 
That very evening Mr. Fogg was due at Shanghai , if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama . 
Had there been no storm , during which several hours were lost , they would be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination . 
The wind grew decidedly calmer , and happily the sea fell with it . 
All sails were now hoisted , and at noon the Tankadere was within forty-five miles of Shanghai . 
There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish that distance . 
All on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- Phileas Fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . 
The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! 
It was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . 
Still , the Tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents John Bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of Shanghai River . 
Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream . 
At seven they were still three miles from Shanghai . 
The pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him . 
He looked at Mr. Fogg . 
Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake . 
At this moment , also , a long black funnel , crowned with wreaths of smoke , appeared on the edge of the waters . 
It was the American steamer , leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time . 
`` Confound her ! '' 
cried John Bunsby , pushing back the rudder with a desperate jerk . 
`` Signal her ! '' 
said Phileas Fogg quietly . 
A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere , for making signals in the fogs . 
It was loaded to the muzzle ; but just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole , Mr. Fogg said , `` Hoist your flag ! '' 
The flag was run up at half-mast , and , this being the signal of distress , it was hoped that the American steamer , perceiving it , would change her course a little , so as to succour the pilot-boat . 
`` Fire ! '' 
said Mr. Fogg . 
And the booming of the little cannon resounded in the air . 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT FINDS OUT THAT , EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES , IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONE 'S POCKET The Carnatic , setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the 7th of November , directed her course at full steam towards Japan . 
She carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers . 
Two state-rooms in the rear were , however , unoccupied -- those which had been engaged by Phileas Fogg . 
The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye , staggering gait , and disordered hair , was seen to emerge from the second cabin , and to totter to a seat on deck . 
It was Passepartout ; and what had happened to him was as follows : Shortly after Fix left the opium den , two waiters had lifted the unconscious Passepartout , and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers . 
Three hours later , pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea , the poor fellow awoke , and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic . 
The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor , and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness . 
Staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls , falling down and creeping up again , and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct , he kept crying out , `` The Carnatic ! 
the Carnatic ! '' 
The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay , on the point of starting . 
Passepartout had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the Carnatic was moving off . 
Several sailors , who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene , carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin , and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from China . 
Thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the Carnatic , and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze . 
The pure air sobered him . 
He began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task ; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , Fix 's revelation , and the opium-house . 
`` It is evident , '' said he to himself , `` that I have been abominably drunk ! 
What will Mr. Fogg say ? 
At least I have not missed the steamer , which is the most important thing . '' 
Then , as Fix occurred to him : `` As for that rascal , I hope we are well rid of him , and that he has not dared , as he proposed , to follow us on board the Carnatic . 
A detective on the track of Mr. Fogg , accused of robbing the Bank of England ! 
Pshaw ! 
Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I am a murderer . '' 
Should he divulge Fix 's real errand to his master ? 
Would it do to tell the part the detective was playing . 
Would it not be better to wait until Mr. Fogg reached London again , and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world , and have a good laugh over it ? 
No doubt ; at least , it was worth considering . 
The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg , and apologise for his singular behaviour . 
Passepartout got up and proceeded , as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer , to the after-deck . 
He saw no one who resembled either his master or Aouda . 
`` Good ! '' 
muttered he ; `` Aouda has not got up yet , and Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist . '' 
He descended to the saloon . 
Mr. Fogg was not there . 
Passepartout had only , however , to ask the purser the number of his master 's state-room . 
The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of Fogg . 
`` I beg your pardon , '' said Passepartout persistently . 
`` He is a tall gentleman , quiet , and not very talkative , and has with him a young lady -- '' `` There is no young lady on board , '' interrupted the purser . 
`` Here is a list of the passengers ; you may see for yourself . '' 
Passepartout scanned the list , but his master 's name was not upon it . 
All at once an idea struck him . 
`` Ah ! 
am I on the Carnatic ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` On the way to Yokohama ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat ; but , though he was really on the Carnatic , his master was not there . 
He fell thunderstruck on a seat . 
He saw it all now . 
He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed , that he should have informed his master of that fact , and that he had not done so . 
It was his fault , then , that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer . 
Yes , but it was still more the fault of the traitor who , in order to separate him from his master , and detain the latter at Hong Kong , had inveigled him into getting drunk ! 
He now saw the detective 's trick ; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined , his bet was lost , and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned ! 
At this thought Passepartout tore his hair . 
Ah , if Fix ever came within his reach , what a settling of accounts there would be !
