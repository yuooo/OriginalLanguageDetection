Boats , laden with soldiers , were seen approaching ; and in three directions , for the purpose of landing at three points at once . 
`` What must be done ? '' 
said an officer of the guard . 
`` Stop them ; and if they persist , fire ! '' 
said Aramis . 
Five minutes later , the cannonade commenced . 
These were the shots that D'Artagnan had heard as he landed in France . 
But the boats were too near the mole to allow the cannon to aim correctly . 
They landed , and the combat commenced hand to hand . 
`` What 's the matter , Porthos ? '' 
said Aramis to his friend . 
`` Nothing ! 
nothing ! 
- only my legs ; it is really incomprehensible ! 
- they will be better when we charge . '' 
In fact , Porthos and Aramis did charge with such vigor , and so thoroughly animated their men , that the royalists re-embarked precipitately , without gaining anything but the wounds they carried away . 
`` Eh ! 
but Porthos , '' cried Aramis , `` we must have a prisoner , quick ! 
quick ! '' 
Porthos bent over the stair of the mole , and seized by the nape of the neck one of the officers of the royal army who was waiting to embark till all his people should be in the boat . 
The arm of the giant lifted up his prey , which served him as a buckler , and he recovered himself without a shot being fired at him . 
`` Here is a prisoner for you , '' said Porthos coolly to Aramis . 
`` Well ! '' 
cried the latter , laughing , `` did you not calumniate your legs ? '' 
`` It was not with my legs I captured him , '' said Porthos , `` it was with my arms ! '' 
: The Son of Biscarrat . 
The Bretons of the Isle were very proud of this victory ; Aramis did not encourage them in the feeling . 
`` What will happen , '' said he to Porthos , when everybody was gone home , `` will be that the anger of the king will be roused by the account of the resistance ; and that these brave people will be decimated or shot when they are taken , which can not fail to take place . '' 
`` From which it results , then , '' said Porthos , `` that what we have done is of not the slightest use . '' 
`` For the moment it may be , '' replied the bishop , `` for we have a prisoner from whom we shall learn what our enemies are preparing to do . '' 
`` Yes , let us interrogate the prisoner , '' said Porthos , `` and the means of making him speak are very simple . 
We are going to supper ; we will invite him to join us ; as he drinks he will talk . '' 
This was done . 
The officer was at first rather uneasy , but became reassured on seeing what sort of men he had to deal with . 
He gave , without having any fear of compromising himself , all the details imaginable of the resignation and departure of D'Artagnan . 
He explained how , after that departure , the new leader of the expedition had ordered a surprise upon Belle-Isle . 
There his explanations stopped . 
Aramis and Porthos exchanged a glance that evinced their despair . 
No more dependence to be placed now on D'Artagnan 's fertile imagination - no further resource in the event of defeat . 
Aramis , continuing his interrogations , asked the prisoner what the leaders of the expedition contemplated doing with the leaders of Belle-Isle . 
`` The orders are , '' replied he , `` to kill during combat , or hang afterwards . '' 
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other again , and the color mounted to their faces . 
`` I am too light for the gallows , '' replied Aramis ; `` people like me are not hung . '' 
`` And I am too heavy , '' said Porthos ; `` people like me break the cord . '' 
`` I am sure , '' said the prisoner , gallantly , `` that we could have guaranteed you the exact kind of death you preferred . '' 
`` A thousand thanks ! '' 
said Aramis , seriously . 
Porthos bowed . 
`` One more cup of wine to your health , '' said he , drinking himself . 
From one subject to another the chat with the officer was prolonged . 
He was an intelligent gentleman , and suffered himself to be led on by the charm of Aramis 's wit and Porthos 's cordial bonhomie . 
`` Pardon me , '' said he , `` if I address a question to you ; but men who are in their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little . '' 
`` Address it ! '' 
cried Porthos ; `` address it ! '' 
`` Speak , '' said Aramis . 
`` Were you not , gentlemen , both in the musketeers of the late king ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , and amongst the best of them , if you please , '' said Porthos . 
`` That is true ; I should say even the best of all soldiers , messieurs , if I did not fear to offend the memory of my father . '' 
`` Of your father ? '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` Do you know what my name is ? '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
no , monsieur ; but you can tell us , and - '' `` I am called Georges de Biscarrat . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
cried Porthos , in his turn . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Do you remember that name , Aramis ? '' 
`` Biscarrat ! '' 
reflected the bishop . 
`` It seems to me - '' `` Try to recollect , monsieur , '' said the officer . 
`` Pardieu ! 
that wo n't take me long , '' said Porthos . 
`` Biscarrat - called Cardinal - one of the four who interrupted us on the day on which we formed our friendship with D'Artagnan , sword in hand . '' 
`` Precisely , gentlemen . '' 
`` The only one , '' cried Aramis , eagerly , `` we could not scratch . '' 
`` Consequently , a capital blade ? '' 
said the prisoner . 
`` That 's true ! 
most true ! '' 
exclaimed both friends together . 
`` Ma foi ! 
Monsieur Biscarrat , we are delighted to make the acquaintance of such a brave man 's son . '' 
Biscarrat pressed the hands held out by the two musketeers . 
Aramis looked at Porthos as much as to say , `` Here is a man who will help us , '' and without delay , - `` Confess , monsieur , '' said he , `` that it is good to have once been a good man . '' '' 
`` My father always said so , monsieur . '' 
`` Confess , likewise , that it is a sad circumstance in which you find yourself , of falling in with men destined to be shot or hung , and to learn that these men are old acquaintances , in fact , hereditary friends . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are not reserved for such a frightful fate as that , messieurs and friends ! '' 
said the young man , warmly . 
`` Bah ! 
you said so yourself . '' 
`` I said so just now , when I did not know you ; but now that I know you , I say - you will evade this dismal fate , if you wish ! '' 
`` How - if we wish ? '' 
echoed Aramis , whose eyes beamed with intelligence as he looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos . 
`` Provided , '' continued Porthos , looking , in his turn , with noble intrepidity , at M. Biscarrat and the bishop - `` provided nothing disgraceful be required of us . '' 
`` Nothing at all will be required of you , gentlemen , '' replied the officer - `` what should they ask of you ? 
If they find you they will kill you , that is a predetermined thing ; try , then , gentlemen , to prevent their finding you . '' 
`` I do n't think I am mistaken , '' said Porthos , with dignity ; `` but it appears evident to me that if they want to find us , they must come and seek us here . '' 
`` In that you are perfectly right , my worthy friend , '' replied Aramis , constantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat , who had grown silent and constrained . 
`` You wish , Monsieur de Biscarrat , to say something to us , to make us some overture , and you dare not - is that true ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
gentlemen and friends ! 
it is because by speaking I betray the watchword . 
But , hark ! 
I hear a voice that frees mine by dominating it . '' 
`` Cannon ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Cannon and musketry , too ! '' 
cried the bishop . 
On hearing at a distance , among the rocks , these sinister reports of a combat which they thought had ceased : `` What can that be ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Eh ! 
Pardieu ! '' 
cried Aramis ; `` that is just what I expected . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` That the attack made by you was nothing but a feint ; is not that true , monsieur ? 
And whilst your companions allowed themselves to be repulsed , you were certain of effecting a landing on the other side of the island . '' 
`` Oh ! 
several , monsieur . '' 
`` We are lost , then , '' said the bishop of Vannes , quietly . 
`` Lost ! 
that is possible , '' replied the Seigneur de Pierrefonds , `` but we are not taken or hung . '' 
And so saying , he rose from the table , went to the wall , and coolly took down his sword and pistols , which he examined with the care of an old soldier who is preparing for battle , and who feels that life , in a great measure , depends upon the excellence and right conditions of his arms . 
At the report of the cannon , at the news of the surprise which might deliver up the island to the royal troops , the terrified crowd rushed precipitately to the fort to demand assistance and advice from their leaders . 
Aramis , pale and downcast , between two flambeaux , showed himself at the window which looked into the principal court , full of soldiers waiting for orders and bewildered inhabitants imploring succor . 
`` My friends , '' said D'Herblay , in a grave and sonorous voice , `` M. Fouquet , your protector , your friend , you father , has been arrested by an order of the king , and thrown into the Bastile . '' 
A sustained yell of vengeful fury came floating up to the window at which the bishop stood , and enveloped him in a magnetic field . 
`` Avenge Monsieur Fouquet ! '' 
cried the most excited of his hearers , `` death to the royalists ! '' 
`` No , my friends , '' replied Aramis , solemnly ; `` no , my friends ; no resistance . 
The king is master in his kingdom . 
The king is the mandatory of God . 
The king and God have struck M. Fouquet . 
Humble yourselves before the hand of God . 
Love God and the king , who have struck M. Fouquet . 
But do not avenge your seigneur , do not think of avenging him . 
You would sacrifice yourselves in vain - you , your wives and children , your property , your liberty . 
Lay down your arms , my friends - lay down your arms ! 
since the king commands you so to do - and retire peaceably to your dwellings . 
It is I who ask you to do so ; it is I who beg you to do so ; it is I who now , in the hour of need , command you to do so , in the name of M. Fouquet . '' 
The crowd collected under the window uttered a prolonged roar of anger and terror . 
`` The soldiers of Louis XIV . 
have reached the island , '' continued Aramis . 
`` From this time it would no longer be a fight betwixt them and you - it would be a massacre . 
Begone , then , begone , and forget ; this time I command you , in the name of the Lord of Hosts ! '' 
The mutineers retired slowly , submissive , silent . 
`` Ah ! 
what have you just been saying , my friend ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Biscarrat to the bishop , `` you may save all these inhabitants , but thus you will neither save yourself nor your friend . '' 
`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said the bishop of Vannes , with a singular accent of nobility and courtesy , `` Monsieur de Biscarrat , be kind enough to resume your liberty . '' 
`` I am very willing to do so , monsieur ; but - '' `` That would render us a service , for when announcing to the king 's lieutenant the submission of the islanders , you will perhaps obtain some grace for us on informing him of the manner in which that submission has been effected . '' 
`` Grace ! '' 
replied Porthos with flashing eyes , `` what is the meaning of that word ? '' 
Aramis touched the elbow of his friend roughly , as he had been accustomed to do in the days of their youth , when he wanted to warn Porthos that he had committed , or was about to commit , a blunder . 
Porthos understood him , and was silent immediately . 
`` I will go , messieurs , '' replied Biscarrat , a little surprised likewise at the word `` grace '' pronounced by the haughty musketeer , of and to whom , but a few minutes before , he had related with so much enthusiasm the heroic exploits with which his father had delighted him . 
`` Go , then , Monsieur Biscarrat , '' said Aramis , bowing to him , `` and at parting receive the expression of our entire gratitude . '' 
`` But you , messieurs , you whom I think it an honor to call my friends , since you have been willing to accept that title , what will become of you in the meantime ? '' 
replied the officer , very much agitated at taking leave of the two ancient adversaries of his father . 
`` We will wait here . '' 
`` But , mon Dieu ! 
- the order is precise and formal . '' 
`` I am bishop of Vannes , Monsieur de Biscarrat ; and they no more shoot a bishop than they hang a gentleman . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , monsieur - yes , monseigneur , '' replied Biscarrat ; `` it is true , you are right , there is still that chance for you . 
Then , I will depart , I will repair to the commander of the expedition , the king 's lieutenant . 
Adieu ! 
then , messieurs , or rather , to meet again , I hope . '' 
The worthy officer , jumping upon a horse given him by Aramis , departed in the direction of the sound of cannon , which , by surging the crowd into the fort , had interrupted the conversation of the two friends with their prisoner . 
Aramis watched the departure , and when left alone with Porthos : `` Well , do you comprehend ? '' 
said he . 
`` Ma foi ! 
no . '' 
`` Did not Biscarrat inconvenience you here ? '' 
`` No ; he is a brave fellow . '' 
`` Yes ; but the grotto of Locmaria - is it necessary all the world should know it ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is true , that is true ; I comprehend . 
We are going to escape by the cavern . '' 
`` If you please , '' cried Aramis , gayly . 
`` Forward , friend Porthos ; our boat awaits us . 
King Louis has not caught us - yet . '' 
: The Grotto of Locmaria . 
The cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render it necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to reach it . 
Besides , night was advancing ; midnight had struck at the fort . 
Porthos and Aramis were loaded with money and arms . 
They walked , then , across the heath , which stretched between the mole and the cavern , listening to every noise , in order better to avoid an ambush . 
From time to time , on the road which they had carefully left on their left , passed fugitives coming from the interior , at the news of the landing of the royal troops . 
Aramis and Porthos , concealed behind some projecting mass of rock , collected the words that escaped from the poor people , who fled , trembling , carrying with them their most valuable effects , and tried , whilst listening to their complaints , to gather something from them for their own interest . 
At length , after a rapid race , frequently interrupted by prudent stoppages , they reached the deep grottoes , in which the prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a bark capable of keeping the sea at this fine season . 
`` My good friend , '' said Porthos , panting vigorously , `` we have arrived , it seems . 
But I thought you spoke of three men , three servants , who were to accompany us . 
I do n't see them - where are they ? '' 
`` Why should you see them , Porthos ? '' 
replied Aramis . 
`` They are certainly waiting for us in the cavern , and , no doubt , are resting , having accomplished their rough and difficult task . '' 
Aramis stopped Porthos , who was preparing to enter the cavern . 
`` Will you allow me , my friend , '' said he to the giant , `` to pass in first ? 
I know the signal I have given to these men ; who , not hearing it , would be very likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark . '' 
`` Go on , then , Aramis ; go on - go first ; you impersonate wisdom and foresight ; go . 
Ah ! 
there is that fatigue again , of which I spoke to you . 
It has just seized me afresh . '' 
Aramis left Porthos sitting at the entrance of the grotto , and bowing his head , he penetrated into the interior of the cavern , imitating the cry of the owl . 
A little plaintive cooing , a scarcely distinct echo , replied from the depths of the cave . 
Aramis pursued his way cautiously , and soon was stopped by the same kind of cry as he had first uttered , within ten paces of him . 
`` Are you there , Yves ? '' 
said the bishop . 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; Goenne is here likewise . 
His son accompanies us . '' 
`` That is well . 
Are all things ready ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Go to the entrance of the grottoes , my good Yves , and you will there find the Seigneur de Pierrefonds , who is resting after the fatigue of our journey . 
And if he should happen not to be able to walk , lift him up , and bring him hither to me . '' 
The three men obeyed . 
But the recommendation given to his servants was superfluous . 
Porthos , refreshed , had already commenced the descent , and his heavy step resounded amongst the cavities , formed and supported by columns of porphyry and granite . 
As soon as the Seigneur de Bracieux had rejoined the bishop , the Bretons lighted a lantern with which they were furnished , and Porthos assured his friend that he felt as strong again as ever . 
`` Let us inspect the boat , '' said Aramis , `` and satisfy ourselves at once what it will hold . '' 
`` Do not go too near with the light , '' said the patron Yves ; `` for as you desired me , monseigneur , I have placed under the bench of the poop , in the coffer you know of , the barrel of powder , and the musket-charges that you sent me from the fort . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Aramis ; and , taking the lantern himself , he examined minutely all parts of the canoe , with the precautions of a man who is neither timid nor ignorant in the face of danger . 
The canoe was long , light , drawing little water , thin of keel ; in short , one of those that have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle ; a little high in its sides , solid upon the water , very manageable , furnished with planks which , in uncertain weather , formed a sort of deck over which the waves might glide , so as to protect the rowers . 
In two well-closed coffers , placed beneath the benches of the prow and the poop , Aramis found bread , biscuit , dried fruits , a quarter of bacon , a good provision of water in leathern bottles ; the whole forming rations sufficient for people who did not mean to quit the coast , and would be able to revictual , if necessity commanded . 
The arms , eight muskets , and as many horse-pistols , were in good condition , and all loaded . 
There were additional oars , in case of accident , and that little sail called trinquet , which assists the speed of the canoe at the same time the boatmen row , and is so useful when the breeze is slack . 
When Aramis had seen to all these things , and appeared satisfied with the result of his inspection , `` Let us consult Porthos , '' said he , `` to know if we must endeavor to get the boat out by the unknown extremity of the grotto , following the descent and the shade of the cavern , or whether it be better , in the open air , to make it slide upon its rollers through the bushes , leveling the road of the little beach , which is but twenty feet high , and gives , at high tide , three or four fathoms of good water upon a sound bottom . '' 
`` It must be as you please , monseigneur , '' replied the skipper Yves , respectfully ; `` but I do n't believe that by the slope of the cavern , and in the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat , the road will be so convenient as the open air . 
I know the beach well , and can certify that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden ; the interior of the grotto , on the contrary , is rough ; without reckoning , monseigneur , that at its extremity we shall come to the trench which leads into the sea , and perhaps the canoe will not pass down it . '' 
`` I have made my calculation , '' said the bishop , `` and I am certain it will pass . '' 
`` So be it ; I wish it may , monseigneur , '' continued Yves ; `` but your highness knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the trench , there is an enormous stone to be lifted - that under which the fox always passes , and which closes the trench like a door . '' 
`` It can be raised , '' said Porthos ; `` that is nothing . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I know that monseigneur has the strength of ten men , '' replied Yves ; `` but that is giving him a great deal of trouble . '' 
`` I think the skipper may be right , '' said Aramis ; `` let us try the open-air passage . '' 
`` The more so , monseigneur , '' continued the fisherman , `` that we should not be able to embark before day , it will require so much labor , and that as soon as daylight appears , a good vedette placed outside the grotto would be necessary , indispensable even , to watch the maneuvers of the lighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us . '' 
`` Yes , yes , Yves , your reasons are good ; we will go by the beach . '' 
And the three robust Bretons went to the boat , and were beginning to place their rollers underneath it to put it in motion , when the distant barking of dogs was heard , proceeding from the interior of the island . 
Aramis darted out of the grotto , followed by Porthos . 
Dawn just tinted with purple and white the waves and plain ; through the dim light , melancholy fir-trees waved their tender branches over the pebbles , and long flights of crows were skimming with their black wings the shimmering fields of buckwheat . 
In a quarter of an hour it would be clear daylight ; the wakened birds announced it to all nature . 
The barkings which had been heard , which had stopped the three fishermen engaged in moving the boat , and had brought Aramis and Porthos out of the cavern , now seemed to come from a deep gorge within about a league of the grotto . 
`` It is a pack of hounds , '' said Porthos ; `` the dogs are on a scent . '' 
`` Who can be hunting at such a moment as this ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` And this way , particularly , '' continued Porthos , `` where they might expect the army of the royalists . '' 
`` The noise comes nearer . 
Yes , you are right , Porthos , the dogs are on a scent . 
But , Yves ! '' 
cried Aramis , `` come here ! 
come here ! '' 
Yves ran towards him , letting fall the cylinder which he was about to place under the boat when the bishop 's call interrupted him . 
`` What is the meaning of this hunt , skipper ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Eh ! 
monseigneur , I can not understand it , '' replied the Breton . 
`` It is not at such a moment that the Seigneur de Locmaria would hunt . 
No , and yet the dogs - '' `` Unless they have escaped from the kennel . '' 
`` No , '' said Goenne , `` they are not the Seigneur de Locmaria 's hounds . '' 
`` In common prudence , '' said Aramis , `` let us go back into the grotto ; the voices evidently draw nearer , we shall soon know what we have to trust to . '' 
They re-entered , but had scarcely proceeded a hundred steps in the darkness , when a noise like the hoarse sigh of a creature in distress resounded through the cavern , and breathless , rapid , terrified , a fox passed like a flash of lightning before the fugitives , leaped over the boat and disappeared , leaving behind its sour scent , which was perceptible for several seconds under the low vaults of the cave . 
`` The fox ! '' 
cried the Bretons , with the glad surprise of born hunters . 
`` Accursed mischance ! '' 
cried the bishop , `` our retreat is discovered . '' 
`` How so ? '' 
said Porthos ; `` are you afraid of a fox ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
my friend , what do you mean by that ? 
why do you specify the fox ? 
It is not the fox alone . 
Pardieu ! 
But do n't you know , Porthos , that after the foxes come hounds , and after hounds men ? '' 
Porthos hung his head . 
As though to confirm the words of Aramis , they heard the yelping pack approach with frightful swiftness upon the trail . 
Six foxhounds burst at once upon the little heath , with mingling yelps of triumph . 
`` There are the dogs , plain enough ! '' 
said Aramis , posted on the look-out behind a chink in the rocks ; `` now , who are the huntsmen ? '' 
`` If it is the Seigneur de Locmaria 's , '' replied the sailor , `` he will leave the dogs to hunt the grotto , for he knows them , and will not enter in himself , being quite sure that the fox will come out the other side ; it is there he will wait for him . '' 
`` It is not the Seigneur de Locmaria who is hunting , '' replied Aramis , turning pale in spite of his efforts to maintain a placid countenance . 
`` Who is it , then ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Look ! '' 
Porthos applied his eye to the slit , and saw at the summit of a hillock a dozen horsemen urging on their horses in the track of the dogs , shouting , `` Taiaut ! 
taiaut ! '' 
`` The guards ! '' 
said he . 
`` Yes , my friend , the king 's guards . '' 
`` The king 's guards ! 
do you say , monseigneur ? '' 
cried the Bretons , growing pale in turn . 
`` With Biscarrat at their head , mounted upon my gray horse , '' continued Aramis . 
The hounds at the same moment rushed into the grotto like an avalanche , and the depths of the cavern were filled with their deafening cries . 
`` Ah ! 
the devil ! '' 
said Aramis , resuming all his coolness at the sight of this certain , inevitable danger . 
`` I am perfectly satisfied we are lost , but we have , at least , one chance left . 
If the guards who follow their hounds happen to discover there is an issue to the grotto , there is no help for us , for on entering they must see both ourselves and our boat . 
The dogs must not go out of the cavern . 
Their masters must not enter . '' 
`` That is clear , '' said Porthos . 
`` You understand , '' added Aramis , with the rapid precision of command ; `` there are six dogs that will be forced to stop at the great stone under which the fox has glided - but at the too narrow opening of which they must be themselves stopped and killed . '' 
The Bretons sprang forward , knife in hand . 
In a few minutes there was a lamentable concert of angry barks and mortal howls - and then , silence . 
`` That 's well ! '' 
said Aramis , coolly , `` now for the masters ! '' 
`` What is to be done with them ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Wait their arrival , conceal ourselves , and kill them . '' 
`` Kill them ! '' 
replied Porthos . 
`` There are sixteen , '' said Aramis , `` at least , at present . '' 
`` And well armed , '' added Porthos , with a smile of consolation . 
`` It will last about ten minutes , '' said Aramis . 
`` To work ! '' 
And with a resolute air he took up a musket , and placed a hunting-knife between his teeth . 
`` Yves , Goenne , and his son , '' continued Aramis , will pass the muskets to us . 
You , Porthos , will fire when they are close . 
We shall have brought down , at the lowest computation , eight , before the others are aware of anything - that is certain ; then all , there are five of us , will dispatch the other eight , knife in hand . '' 
`` And poor Biscarrat ? '' 
said Porthos . 
Aramis reflected a moment - `` Biscarrat first , '' replied he , coolly . 
`` He knows us . '' 
: The Grotto . 
In spite of the sort of divination which was the remarkable side of the character of Aramis , the event , subject to the risks of things over which uncertainty presides , did not fall out exactly as the bishop of Vannes had foreseen . 
Biscarrat , better mounted than his companions , arrived first at the opening of the grotto , and comprehended that fox and hounds were one and all engulfed in it . 
Only , struck by that superstitious terror which every dark and subterraneous way naturally impresses upon the mind of man , he stopped at the outside of the grotto , and waited till his companions should have assembled round him . 
`` Well ! '' 
asked the young men , coming up , out of breath , and unable to understand the meaning of this inaction . 
`` Well ! 
I can not hear the dogs ; they and the fox must all be lost in this infernal cavern . '' 
`` They were too close up , '' said one of the guards , `` to have lost scent all at once . 
Besides , we should hear them from one side or another . 
They must , as Biscarrat says , be in this grotto . '' 
`` But then , '' said one of the young men , `` why do n't they give tongue ? '' 
`` It is strange ! '' 
muttered another . 
`` Well , but , '' said a fourth , `` let us go into this grotto . 
Does it happen to be forbidden we should enter it ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Biscarrat . 
`` Only , as it looks as dark as a wolf 's mouth , we might break our necks in it . '' 
`` Witness the dogs , '' said a guard , `` who seem to have broken theirs . '' 
`` What the devil can have become of them ? '' 
asked the young men in chorus . 
And every master called his dog by his name , whistled to him in his favorite mode , without a single one replying to either call or whistle . 
`` It is perhaps an enchanted grotto , '' said Biscarrat ; `` let us see . '' 
And , jumping from his horse , he made a step into the grotto . 
`` Stop ! 
stop ! 
I will accompany you , '' said one of the guards , on seeing Biscarrat disappear in the shades of the cavern 's mouth . 
`` No , '' replied Biscarrat , `` there must be something extraordinary in the place - do n't let us risk ourselves all at once . 
If in ten minutes you do not hear of me , you can come in , but not all at once . '' 
`` Be it so , '' said the young man , who , besides , did not imagine that Biscarrat ran much risk in the enterprise , `` we will wait for you . '' 
And without dismounting from their horses , they formed a circle round the grotto . 
Biscarrat entered then alone , and advanced through the darkness till he came in contact with the muzzle of Porthos 's musket . 
The resistance which his chest met with astonished him ; he naturally raised his hand and laid hold of the icy barrel . 
At the same instant , Yves lifted a knife against the young man , which was about to fall upon him with all force of a Breton 's arm , when the iron wrist of Porthos stopped it half-way . 
Then , like low muttering thunder , his voice growled in the darkness , `` I will not have him killed ! '' 
Biscarrat found himself between a protection and a threat , the one almost as terrible as the other . 
However brave the young man might be , he could not prevent a cry escaping him , which Aramis immediately suppressed by placing a handkerchief over his mouth . 
`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said he , in a low voice , `` we mean you no harm , and you must know that if you have recognized us ; but , at the first word , the first groan , the first whisper , we shall be forced to kill you as we have killed your dogs . '' 
`` Yes , I recognize you , gentlemen , '' said the officer , in a low voice . 
`` But why are you here - what are you doing , here ? 
Unfortunate men ! 
I thought you were in the fort . '' 
`` And you , monsieur , you were to obtain conditions for us , I think ? '' 
`` I did all I was able , messieurs , but - '' `` But what ? '' 
`` But there are positive orders . '' 
`` To kill us ? '' 
Biscarrat made no reply . 
It would have cost him too much to speak of the cord to gentlemen . 
Aramis understood the silence of the prisoner . 
`` Monsieur Biscarrat , '' said he , `` you would be already dead if we had not regard for your youth and our ancient association with your father ; but you may yet escape from the place by swearing that you will not tell your companions what you have seen . '' 
`` I will not only swear that I will not speak of it , '' said Biscarrat , `` but I still further swear that I will do everything in the world to prevent my companions from setting foot in the grotto . '' 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried several voices from the outside , coming like a whirlwind into the cave . 
`` Reply , '' said Aramis . 
`` Here I am ! '' 
cried Biscarrat . 
`` Now , begone ; we depend on your loyalty . '' 
And he left his hold of the young man , who hastily returned towards the light . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried the voices , still nearer . 
And the shadows of several human forms projected into the interior of the grotto . 
Biscarrat rushed to meet his friends in order to stop them , and met them just as they were adventuring into the cave . 
Aramis and Porthos listened with the intense attention of men whose life depends upon a breath of air . 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
exclaimed one of the guards , as he came to the light , `` how pale you are ! '' 
`` Pale ! '' 
cried another ; `` you ought to say corpse-color . '' 
`` I ! '' 
said the young man , endeavoring to collect his faculties . 
`` In the name of Heaven ! 
what has happened ? '' 
exclaimed all the voices . 
`` You have not a drop of blood in your veins , my poor friend , '' said one of them , laughing . 
`` Messieurs , it is serious , '' said another , `` he is going to faint ; does any one of you happen to have any salts ? '' 
And they all laughed . 
This hail of jests fell round Biscarrat 's ears like musket-balls in a melee . 
He recovered himself amidst a deluge of interrogations . 
`` What do you suppose I have seen ? ' 
asked he . 
`` I was too hot when I entered the grotto , and I have been struck with a chill . 
That is all . '' 
`` But the dogs , the dogs ; have you seen them again - did you see anything of them - do you know anything about them ? '' 
`` I suppose they have got out some other way . '' 
`` Messieurs , '' said one of the young men , `` there is in that which is going on , in the paleness and silence of our friend , a mystery which Biscarrat will not , or can not reveal . 
Only , and this is certain , Biscarrat has seen something in the grotto . 
Well , for my part , I am very curious to see what it is , even if it is the devil ! 
To the grotto ! 
messieurs , to the grotto ! '' 
`` To the grotto ! '' 
repeated all the voices . 
And the echo of the cavern carried like a menace to Porthos and Aramis , `` To the grotto ! 
to the grotto ! '' 
Biscarrat threw himself before his companions . 
`` Messieurs ! 
messieurs ! '' 
cried he , `` in the name of Heaven ! 
do not go in ! '' 
`` Why , what is there so terrific in the cavern ? '' 
asked several at once . 
`` Come , speak , Biscarrat . '' 
`` Decidedly , it is the devil he has seen , '' repeated he who had before advanced that hypothesis . 
`` Well , '' said another , `` if he has seen him , he need not be selfish ; he may as well let us have a look at him in turn . '' 
`` Messieurs ! 
messieurs ! 
I beseech you , '' urged Biscarrat . 
`` Nonsense ! 
Let us pass ! '' 
`` Messieurs , I implore you not to enter ! '' 
`` Why , you went in yourself . '' 
Then one of the officers , who - of a riper age than the others - had till this time remained behind , and had said nothing , advanced . 
`` Messieurs , '' said he , with a calmness which contrasted with the animation of the young men , `` there is in there some person , or something , that is not the devil ; but which , whatever it may be , has had sufficient power to silence our dogs . 
We must discover who this some one is , or what this something is . '' 
Biscarrat made a last effort to stop his friends , but it was useless . 
In vain he threw himself before the rashest ; in vain he clung to the rocks to bar the passage ; the crowd of young men rushed into the cave , in the steps of the officer who had spoken last , but who had sprung in first , sword in hand , to face the unknown danger . 
Biscarrat , repulsed by his friends , unable to accompany them , without passing in the eyes of Porthos and Aramis for a traitor and a perjurer , with painfully attentive ear and unconsciously supplicating hands leaned against the rough side of a rock which he thought must be exposed to the fire of the musketeers . 
As to the guards , they penetrated further and further , with exclamations that grew fainter as they advanced . 
All at once , a discharge of musketry , growling like thunder , exploded in the entrails of the vault . 
Two or three balls were flattened against the rock on which Biscarrat was leaning . 
At the same instant , cries , shrieks , imprecations burst forth , and the little troop of gentlemen reappeared - some pale , some bleeding - all enveloped in a cloud of smoke , which the outer air seemed to suck from the depths of the cavern . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried the fugitives , `` you knew there was an ambuscade in that cavern , and you did not warn us ! 
Biscarrat , you are the cause that four of us are murdered men ! 
Woe be to you , Biscarrat ! '' 
`` You are the cause of my being wounded unto death , '' said one of the young men , letting a gush of scarlet life-blood vomit in his palm , and spattering it into Biscarrat 's livid face . 
`` My blood be on your head ! '' 
And he rolled in agony at the feet of the young man . 
`` But , at least , tell us who is there ? '' 
cried several furious voices . 
Biscarrat remained silent . 
`` Tell us , or die ! '' 
cried the wounded man , raising himself upon one knee , and lifting towards his companion an arm bearing a useless sword . 
Biscarrat rushed towards him , opening his breast for the blow , but the wounded man fell back not to rise again , uttering a groan which was his last . 
Biscarrat , with hair on end , haggard eyes , and bewildered head , advanced towards the interior of the cavern , saying , `` You are right . 
Death to me , who have allowed my comrades to be assassinated . 
I am a worthless wretch ! '' 
And throwing away his sword , for he wished to die without defending himself , he rushed head foremost into the cavern . 
The others followed him . 
The eleven who remained out of sixteen imitated his example ; but they did not go further than the first . 
A second discharge laid five upon the icy sand ; and as it was impossible to see whence this murderous thunder issued , the others fell back with a terror that can be better imagined than described . 
But , far from flying , as the others had done , Biscarrat remained safe and sound , seated on a fragment of rock , and waited . 
There were only six gentlemen left . 
`` Seriously , '' said one of the survivors , `` is it the devil ? '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
it is much worse , '' said another . 
`` Ask Biscarrat , he knows . '' 
`` Where is Biscarrat ? '' 
The young men looked round them , and saw that Biscarrat did not answer . 
`` He is dead ! '' 
said two or three voices . 
`` Oh ! 
no ! '' 
replied another , `` I saw him through the smoke , sitting quietly on a rock . 
He is in the cavern ; he is waiting for us . '' 
`` He must know who are there . '' 
`` And how should he know them ? '' 
`` He was taken prisoner by the rebels . '' 
`` That is true . 
Well ! 
let us call him , and learn from him whom we have to deal with . '' 
And all voices shouted , `` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
But Biscarrat did not answer . 
`` Good ! '' 
said the officer who had shown so much coolness in the affair . 
`` We have no longer any need of him ; here are reinforcements coming . '' 
In fact , a company of guards , left in the rear by their officers , whom the ardor of the chase had carried away - from seventy-five to eighty men - arrived in good order , led by their captain and the first lieutenant . 
The five officers hastened to meet their soldiers ; and , in language the eloquence of which may be easily imagined , they related the adventure , and asked for aid . 
The captain interrupted them . 
`` Where are your companions ? '' 
demanded he . 
`` Dead ! '' 
`` But there were sixteen of you ! ''
