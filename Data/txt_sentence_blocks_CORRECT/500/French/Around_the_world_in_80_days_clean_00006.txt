He rushed along the track , jumped on the rear platform of the train , and fell , exhausted , into one of the seats . 
Passepartout , who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast , approached him with lively interest , and learned that he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene . 
When the Mormon had recovered his breath , Passepartout ventured to ask him politely how many wives he had ; for , from the manner in which he had decamped , it might be thought that he had twenty at least . 
`` One , sir , '' replied the Mormon , raising his arms heavenward -- `` one , and that was enough ! '' 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT DOES NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING ANYBODY LISTEN TO REASON The train , on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden , passed northward for an hour as far as Weber River , having completed nearly nine hundred miles from San Francisco . 
From this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains . 
It was in the section included between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road , and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile , instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains . 
But the engineers , instead of violating nature , avoided its difficulties by winding around , instead of penetrating the rocks . 
One tunnel only , fourteen thousand feet in length , was pierced in order to arrive at the great basin . 
The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the Great Salt Lake . 
From this point it described a long curve , descending towards Bitter Creek Valley , to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific . 
There were many creeks in this mountainous region , and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek , Green Creek , and others , upon culverts . 
Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on , while Fix longed to get out of this difficult region , and was more anxious than Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents , and set foot on English soil . 
At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station , and twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory , following the valley of Bitter Creek throughout . 
The next day , 7th December , they stopped for a quarter of an hour at Green River station . 
Snow had fallen abundantly during the night , but , being mixed with rain , it had half melted , and did not interrupt their progress . 
The bad weather , however , annoyed Passepartout ; for the accumulation of snow , by blocking the wheels of the cars , would certainly have been fatal to Mr. Fogg 's tour . 
`` What an idea ! '' 
he said to himself . 
`` Why did my master make this journey in winter ? 
Could n't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances ? '' 
While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature , Aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause . 
Several passengers had got off at Green River , and were walking up and down the platforms ; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp Proctor , the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San Francisco meeting . 
Not wishing to be recognised , the young woman drew back from the window , feeling much alarm at her discovery . 
She was attached to the man who , however coldly , gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion . 
She did not comprehend , perhaps , the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her , which she called gratitude , but which , though she was unconscious of it , was really more than that . 
Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom Mr. Fogg desired , sooner or later , to call to account for his conduct . 
Chance alone , it was clear , had brought Colonel Proctor on this train ; but there he was , and it was necessary , at all hazards , that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary . 
Aouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and Passepartout whom she had seen . 
`` That Proctor on this train ! '' 
cried Fix . 
`` Well , reassure yourself , madam ; before he settles with Mr. Fogg ; he has got to deal with me ! 
It seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two . '' 
`` And , besides , '' added Passepartout , `` I 'll take charge of him , colonel as he is . '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' resumed Aouda , `` Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge him . 
He said that he would come back to America to find this man . 
Should he perceive Colonel Proctor , we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results . 
He must not see him . '' 
`` You are right , madam , '' replied Fix ; `` a meeting between them might ruin all . 
Whether he were victorious or beaten , Mr. Fogg would be delayed , and -- '' `` And , '' added Passepartout , `` that would play the game of the gentlemen of the Reform Club . 
In four days we shall be in New York . 
Well , if my master does not leave this car during those four days , we may hope that chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American . 
We must , if possible , prevent his stirring out of it . '' 
The conversation dropped . 
Mr. Fogg had just woke up , and was looking out of the window . 
Soon after Passepartout , without being heard by his master or Aouda , whispered to the detective , `` Would you really fight for him ? '' 
`` I would do anything , '' replied Fix , in a tone which betrayed determined will , `` to get him back living to Europe ! '' 
Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame , but his confidence in his master remained unbroken . 
Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car , to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel ? 
It ought not to be a difficult task , since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious . 
The detective , at least , seemed to have found a way ; for , after a few moments , he said to Mr. Fogg , `` These are long and slow hours , sir , that we are passing on the railway . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Mr. Fogg ; `` but they pass . '' 
`` You were in the habit of playing whist , '' resumed Fix , `` on the steamers . '' 
`` Yes ; but it would be difficult to do so here . 
I have neither cards nor partners . '' 
`` Oh , but we can easily buy some cards , for they are sold on all the American trains . 
And as for partners , if madam plays -- '' `` Certainly , sir , '' Aouda quickly replied ; `` I understand whist . 
It is part of an English education . '' 
`` I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game . 
Well , here are three of us , and a dummy -- '' `` As you please , sir , '' replied Phileas Fogg , heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway . 
Passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward , and soon returned with two packs of cards , some pins , counters , and a shelf covered with cloth . 
The game commenced . 
Aouda understood whist sufficiently well , and even received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg . 
As for the detective , he was simply an adept , and worthy of being matched against his present opponent . 
`` Now , '' thought Passepartout , `` we 've got him . 
He wo n't budge . '' 
At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at Bridger Pass , seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four feet above the level of the sea , one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains . 
After going about two hundred miles , the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the Atlantic , and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road . 
On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the North Platte River , already appeared . 
The whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains , the highest being Laramie Peak . 
Between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . 
On the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas River , one of the great tributaries of the Missouri . 
At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort Halleck , which commands that section ; and in a few more hours the Rocky Mountains were crossed . 
There was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country . 
The snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold . 
Large birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance . 
No wild beast appeared on the plain . 
It was a desert in its vast nakedness . 
After a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , Mr. Fogg and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped . 
Passepartout put his head out of the door , but saw nothing to cause the delay ; no station was in view . 
Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to get out ; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant , `` See what is the matter . '' 
Passepartout rushed out of the car . 
Thirty or forty passengers had already descended , amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor . 
The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way . 
The engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man , whom the station-master at Medicine Bow , the next stopping place , had sent on before . 
The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion , in which Colonel Proctor , with his insolent manner , was conspicuous . 
Passepartout , joining the group , heard the signal-man say , `` No ! 
you ca n't pass . 
The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky , and would not bear the weight of the train . '' 
This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids , about a mile from the place where they now were . 
According to the signal-man , it was in a ruinous condition , several of the iron wires being broken ; and it was impossible to risk the passage . 
He did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge . 
It may be taken for granted that , rash as the Americans usually are , when they are prudent there is good reason for it . 
Passepartout , not daring to apprise his master of what he heard , listened with set teeth , immovable as a statue . 
`` Hum ! '' 
cried Colonel Proctor ; `` but we are not going to stay here , I imagine , and take root in the snow ? '' 
`` Colonel , '' replied the conductor , `` we have telegraphed to Omaha for a train , but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow is less than six hours . '' 
`` Six hours ! '' 
cried Passepartout . 
`` Certainly , '' returned the conductor , `` besides , it will take us as long as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot . '' 
`` But it is only a mile from here , '' said one of the passengers . 
`` Yes , but it 's on the other side of the river . '' 
`` And ca n't we cross that in a boat ? '' 
asked the colonel . 
`` That 's impossible . 
The creek is swelled by the rains . 
It is a rapid , and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford . '' 
The colonel launched a volley of oaths , denouncing the railway company and the conductor ; and Passepartout , who was furious , was not disinclined to make common cause with him . 
Here was an obstacle , indeed , which all his master 's banknotes could not remove . 
There was a general disappointment among the passengers , who , without reckoning the delay , saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow . 
They grumbled and protested , and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg 's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game . 
Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred , and , with hanging head , he was turning towards the car , when the engineer , a true Yankee , named Forster called out , `` Gentlemen , perhaps there is a way , after all , to get over . '' 
`` On the bridge ? '' 
asked a passenger . 
`` On the bridge . '' 
`` With our train ? '' 
`` With our train . '' 
Passepartout stopped short , and eagerly listened to the engineer . 
`` But the bridge is unsafe , '' urged the conductor . 
`` No matter , '' replied Forster ; `` I think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over . '' 
`` The devil ! '' 
muttered Passepartout . 
But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer 's proposal , and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted , and found the plan a very feasible one . 
He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges , by putting on full steam ; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer 's mind . 
`` We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , '' said one . 
`` Eighty ! 
ninety ! '' 
Passepartout was astounded , and , though ready to attempt anything to get over Medicine Creek , thought the experiment proposed a little too American . 
`` Besides , '' thought he , `` there 's a still more simple way , and it does not even occur to any of these people ! 
Sir , '' said he aloud to one of the passengers , `` the engineer 's plan seems to me a little dangerous , but -- '' `` Eighty chances ! '' 
replied the passenger , turning his back on him . 
`` I know it , '' said Passepartout , turning to another passenger , `` but a simple idea -- '' `` Ideas are no use , '' returned the American , shrugging his shoulders , `` as the engineer assures us that we can pass . '' 
`` Doubtless , '' urged Passepartout , `` we can pass , but perhaps it would be more prudent -- '' `` What ! 
Prudent ! '' 
cried Colonel Proctor , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously . 
`` At full speed , do n't you see , at full speed ! '' 
`` I know -- I see , '' repeated Passepartout ; `` but it would be , if not more prudent , since that word displeases you , at least more natural -- '' `` Who ! 
What ! 
What 's the matter with this fellow ? '' 
cried several . 
The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself . 
`` Are you afraid ? '' 
asked Colonel Proctor . 
`` I afraid ? 
Very well ; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they ! '' 
`` All aboard ! '' 
cried the conductor . 
`` Yes , all aboard ! '' 
repeated Passepartout , and immediately . 
`` But they ca n't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot , and let the train come after ! '' 
But no one heard this sage reflection , nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice . 
The passengers resumed their places in the cars . 
Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed . 
The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game . 
The locomotive whistled vigorously ; the engineer , reversing the steam , backed the train for nearly a mile -- retiring , like a jumper , in order to take a longer leap . 
Then , with another whistle , he began to move forward ; the train increased its speed , and soon its rapidity became frightful ; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive ; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second . 
They perceived that the whole train , rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour , hardly bore upon the rails at all . 
And they passed over ! 
It was like a flash . 
No one saw the bridge . 
The train leaped , so to speak , from one bank to the other , and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station . 
But scarcely had the train passed the river , when the bridge , completely ruined , fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow . 
IN WHICH CERTAIN INCIDENTS ARE NARRATED WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE MET WITH ON AMERICAN RAILROADS The train pursued its course , that evening , without interruption , passing Fort Saunders , crossing Cheyne Pass , and reaching Evans Pass . 
The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey , eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea . 
The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains , levelled by nature . 
A branch of the `` grand trunk '' led off southward to Denver , the capital of Colorado . 
The country round about is rich in gold and silver , and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there . 
Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San Francisco , in three days and three nights ; four days and nights more would probably bring them to New York . 
Phileas Fogg was not as yet behind-hand . 
During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left ; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road , marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado . 
They entered Nebraska at eleven , passed near Sedgwick , and touched at Julesburg , on the southern branch of the Platte River . 
It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October , 1867 , by the chief engineer , General Dodge . 
Two powerful locomotives , carrying nine cars of invited guests , amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant , vice-president of the road , stopped at this point ; cheers were given , the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle , fireworks were let off , and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train . 
Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad , a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation , thrown across the desert , and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist . 
The whistle of the locomotive , more powerful than Amphion 's lyre , was about to bid them rise from American soil . 
Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning , and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha . 
The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River , on its left bank . 
At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte , built between the two arms of the river , which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery , a large tributary , whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha . 
The one hundred and first meridian was passed . 
Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game ; no one -- not even the dummy -- complained of the length of the trip . 
Fix had begun by winning several guineas , which he seemed likely to lose ; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg . 
During the morning , chance distinctly favoured that gentleman . 
Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands . 
Once , having resolved on a bold stroke , he was on the point of playing a spade , when a voice behind him said , `` I should play a diamond . '' 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Fix raised their heads , and beheld Colonel Proctor . 
Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once . 
`` Ah ! 
it 's you , is it , Englishman ? '' 
cried the colonel ; `` it 's you who are going to play a spade ! '' 
`` And who plays it , '' replied Phileas Fogg coolly , throwing down the ten of spades . 
`` Well , it pleases me to have it diamonds , '' replied Colonel Proctor , in an insolent tone . 
He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played , adding , `` You do n't understand anything about whist . '' 
`` Perhaps I do , as well as another , '' said Phileas Fogg , rising . 
`` You have only to try , son of John Bull , '' replied the colonel . 
Aouda turned pale , and her blood ran cold . 
She seized Mr. Fogg 's arm and gently pulled him back . 
Passepartout was ready to pounce upon the American , who was staring insolently at his opponent . 
But Fix got up , and , going to Colonel Proctor said , `` You forget that it is I with whom you have to deal , sir ; for it was I whom you not only insulted , but struck ! '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` pardon me , but this affair is mine , and mine only . 
The colonel has again insulted me , by insisting that I should not play a spade , and he shall give me satisfaction for it . '' 
`` When and where you will , '' replied the American , `` and with whatever weapon you choose . '' 
Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg ; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his . 
Passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window , but a sign from his master checked him . 
Phileas Fogg left the car , and the American followed him upon the platform . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg to his adversary , `` I am in a great hurry to get back to Europe , and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage . '' 
`` Well , what 's that to me ? '' 
replied Colonel Proctor . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg , very politely , `` after our meeting at San Francisco , I determined to return to America and find you as soon as I had completed the business which called me to England . '' 
`` Really ! '' 
`` Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence ? '' 
`` Why not ten years hence ? '' 
`` I say six months , '' returned Phileas Fogg ; `` and I shall be at the place of meeting promptly . '' 
`` All this is an evasion , '' cried Stamp Proctor . 
`` Now or never ! '' 
`` Very good . 
You are going to New York ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` To Chicago ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` To Omaha ? '' 
`` What difference is it to you ? 
Do you know Plum Creek ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's the next station . 
The train will be there in an hour , and will stop there ten minutes . 
In ten minutes several revolver-shots could be exchanged . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` I will stop at Plum Creek . '' 
`` And I guess you 'll stay there too , '' added the American insolently . 
`` Who knows ? '' 
replied Mr. Fogg , returning to the car as coolly as usual . 
He began to reassure Aouda , telling her that blusterers were never to be feared , and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel , a request which the detective could not refuse . 
Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness . 
At eleven o'clock the locomotive 's whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station . 
Mr. Fogg rose , and , followed by Fix , went out upon the platform . 
Passepartout accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers . 
Aouda remained in the car , as pale as death . 
The door of the next car opened , and Colonel Proctor appeared on the platform , attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second . 
But just as the combatants were about to step from the train , the conductor hurried up , and shouted , `` You ca n't get off , gentlemen ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
asked the colonel . 
`` We are twenty minutes late , and we shall not stop . '' 
`` But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman . '' 
`` I am sorry , '' said the conductor ; `` but we shall be off at once . 
There 's the bell ringing now . '' 
The train started . 
`` I 'm really very sorry , gentlemen , '' said the conductor . 
`` Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you . 
But , after all , as you have not had time to fight here , why not fight as we go along ? 
`` That would n't be convenient , perhaps , for this gentleman , '' said the colonel , in a jeering tone . 
`` It would be perfectly so , '' replied Phileas Fogg . 
`` Well , we are really in America , '' thought Passepartout , `` and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order ! '' 
So muttering , he followed his master . 
The two combatants , their seconds , and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train . 
The last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers , whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments , as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle . 
The passengers granted the request with alacrity , and straightway disappeared on the platform . 
The car , which was some fifty feet long , was very convenient for their purpose . 
The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle , and fire at their ease . 
Never was duel more easily arranged . 
Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor , each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers , entered the car . 
The seconds , remaining outside , shut them in . 
They were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive . 
After an interval of two minutes , what remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car . 
Nothing could be more simple . 
Indeed , it was all so simple that Fix and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack . 
They were listening for the whistle agreed upon , when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air , accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were . 
The reports continued in front and the whole length of the train . 
Cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars . 
Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg , revolvers in hand , hastily quitted their prison , and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous . 
They then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux . 
This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians , for more than once they had waylaid trains on the road . 
A hundred of them had , according to their habit , jumped upon the steps without stopping the train , with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop . 
The Sioux were armed with guns , from which came the reports , to which the passengers , who were almost all armed , responded by revolver-shots . 
The Indians had first mounted the engine , and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets . 
A Sioux chief , wishing to stop the train , but not knowing how to work the regulator , had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve , and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity . 
The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars , skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs , thrusting open the doors , and fighting hand to hand with the passengers . 
Penetrating the baggage-car , they pillaged it , throwing the trunks out of the train . 
The cries and shots were constant . 
The travellers defended themselves bravely ; some of the cars were barricaded , and sustained a siege , like moving forts , carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour . 
Aouda behaved courageously from the first . 
She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver , which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance . 
Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground , and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms . 
Several passengers , shot or stunned , lay on the seats . 
It was necessary to put an end to the struggle , which had lasted for ten minutes , and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the train was not stopped . 
Fort Kearney station , where there was a garrison , was only two miles distant ; but , that once passed , the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station beyond . 
The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg , when he was shot and fell . 
At the same moment he cried , `` Unless the train is stopped in five minutes , we are lost ! '' 
`` It shall be stopped , '' said Phileas Fogg , preparing to rush from the car . 
`` Stay , monsieur , '' cried Passepartout ; `` I will go . '' 
Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow , who , opening a door unperceived by the Indians , succeeded in slipping under the car ; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head , he made use of his old acrobatic experience , and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars , holding on to the chains , aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes , creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill , and thus gaining the forward end of the train . 
There , suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender , with the other he loosened the safety chains ; but , owing to the traction , he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar , had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out . 
The train , now detached from the engine , remained a little behind , whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed . 
Carried on by the force already acquired , the train still moved for several minutes ; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped , less than a hundred feet from Kearney station . 
The soldiers of the fort , attracted by the shots , hurried up ; the Sioux had not expected them , and decamped in a body before the train entirely stopped . 
But when the passengers counted each other on the station platform several were found missing ; among others the courageous Frenchman , whose devotion had just saved them . 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SIMPLY DOES HIS DUTY Three passengers including Passepartout had disappeared . 
Had they been killed in the struggle ? 
Were they taken prisoners by the Sioux ? 
It was impossible to tell . 
There were many wounded , but none mortally . 
Colonel Proctor was one of the most seriously hurt ; he had fought bravely , and a ball had entered his groin . 
He was carried into the station with the other wounded passengers , to receive such attention as could be of avail . 
Aouda was safe ; and Phileas Fogg , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch . 
Fix was slightly wounded in the arm . 
But Passepartout was not to be found , and tears coursed down Aouda 's cheeks . 
All the passengers had got out of the train , the wheels of which were stained with blood . 
From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of flesh . 
As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind , red trails were visible . 
The last Sioux were disappearing in the south , along the banks of Republican River . 
Mr. Fogg , with folded arms , remained motionless . 
He had a serious decision to make . 
Aouda , standing near him , looked at him without speaking , and he understood her look . 
If his servant was a prisoner , ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians ? 
`` I will find him , living or dead , '' said he quietly to Aouda . 
`` Ah , Mr. -- Mr. Fogg ! '' 
cried she , clasping his hands and covering them with tears . 
`` Living , '' added Mr. Fogg , `` if we do not lose a moment . '' 
Phileas Fogg , by this resolution , inevitably sacrificed himself ; he pronounced his own doom . 
The delay of a single day would make him lose the steamer at New York , and his bet would be certainly lost . 
But as he thought , `` It is my duty , '' he did not hesitate . 
The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there . 
A hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station , should the Sioux attack it . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg to the captain , `` three passengers have disappeared . '' 
`` Dead ? '' 
asked the captain . 
`` Dead or prisoners ; that is the uncertainty which must be solved . 
Do you propose to pursue the Sioux ? '' 
`` That 's a serious thing to do , sir , '' returned the captain . 
`` These Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas , and I can not leave the fort unprotected . '' 
`` The lives of three men are in question , sir , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
`` Doubtless ; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether you can , sir ; but you ought to do so . '' 
`` Nobody here , '' returned the other , `` has a right to teach me my duty . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Mr. Fogg , coldly . 
`` I will go alone . '' 
`` You , sir ! '' 
cried Fix , coming up ; `` you go alone in pursuit of the Indians ? '' 
`` Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish -- him to whom every one present owes his life ? 
I shall go . '' 
`` No , sir , you shall not go alone , '' cried the captain , touched in spite of himself . 
`` No ! 
you are a brave man . 
Thirty volunteers ! '' 
he added , turning to the soldiers . 
The whole company started forward at once . 
The captain had only to pick his men . 
Thirty were chosen , and an old sergeant placed at their head . 
`` Thanks , captain , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` Will you let me go with you ? '' 
asked Fix . 
`` Do as you please , sir . 
But if you wish to do me a favour , you will remain with Aouda . 
In case anything should happen to me -- '' A sudden pallor overspread the detective 's face . 
Separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step ! 
Leave him to wander about in this desert ! 
Fix gazed attentively at Mr. Fogg , and , despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him , he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look . 
`` I will stay , '' said he . 
A few moments after , Mr. Fogg pressed the young woman 's hand , and , having confided to her his precious carpet-bag , went off with the sergeant and his little squad . 
But , before going , he had said to the soldiers , `` My friends , I will divide five thousand dollars among you , if we save the prisoners . '' 
It was then a little past noon . 
Aouda retired to a waiting-room , and there she waited alone , thinking of the simple and noble generosity , the tranquil courage of Phileas Fogg . 
He had sacrificed his fortune , and was now risking his life , all without hesitation , from duty , in silence . 
Fix did not have the same thoughts , and could scarcely conceal his agitation . 
He walked feverishly up and down the platform , but soon resumed his outward composure . 
He now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting Fogg go alone . 
What ! 
This man , whom he had just followed around the world , was permitted now to separate himself from him ! 
He began to accuse and abuse himself , and , as if he were director of police , administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness . 
`` I have been an idiot ! '' 
he thought , `` and this man will see it . 
He has gone , and wo n't come back ! 
But how is it that I , Fix , who have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest , have been so fascinated by him ? 
Decidedly , I am nothing but an ass ! '' 
So reasoned the detective , while the hours crept by all too slowly . 
He did not know what to do . 
Sometimes he was tempted to tell Aouda all ; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences . 
What course should he take ? 
He thought of pursuing Fogg across the vast white plains ; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him . 
Footsteps were easily printed on the snow ! 
But soon , under a new sheet , every imprint would be effaced . 
Fix became discouraged . 
He felt a sort of insurmountable longing to abandon the game altogether . 
He could now leave Fort Kearney station , and pursue his journey homeward in peace . 
Towards two o'clock in the afternoon , while it was snowing hard , long whistles were heard approaching from the east . 
A great shadow , preceded by a wild light , slowly advanced , appearing still larger through the mist , which gave it a fantastic aspect . 
No train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from Omaha to San Francisco was not due till the next day . 
The mystery was soon explained . 
The locomotive , which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles , was that which , having been detached from the train , had continued its route with such terrific rapidity , carrying off the unconscious engineer and stoker . 
It had run several miles , when , the fire becoming low for want of fuel , the steam had slackened ; and it had finally stopped an hour after , some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney . 
Neither the engineer nor the stoker was dead , and , after remaining for some time in their swoon , had come to themselves . 
The train had then stopped . 
The engineer , when he found himself in the desert , and the locomotive without cars , understood what had happened . 
He could not imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train ; but he did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress . 
He did not hesitate what to do . 
It would be prudent to continue on to Omaha , for it would be dangerous to return to the train , which the Indians might still be engaged in pillaging . 
Nevertheless , he began to rebuild the fire in the furnace ; the pressure again mounted , and the locomotive returned , running backwards to Fort Kearney . 
This it was which was whistling in the mist . 
The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the head of the train . 
They could now continue the journey so terribly interrupted . 
Aouda , on seeing the locomotive come up , hurried out of the station , and asked the conductor , `` Are you going to start ? '' 
`` At once , madam . '' 
`` But the prisoners , our unfortunate fellow-travellers -- '' `` I can not interrupt the trip , '' replied the conductor . 
`` We are already three hours behind time . '' 
`` And when will another train pass here from San Francisco ? '' 
`` To-morrow evening , madam . '' 
`` To-morrow evening ! 
But then it will be too late ! 
We must wait -- '' `` It is impossible , '' responded the conductor . 
`` If you wish to go , please get in . '' 
`` I will not go , '' said Aouda . 
Fix had heard this conversation . 
A little while before , when there was no prospect of proceeding on the journey , he had made up his mind to leave Fort Kearney ; but now that the train was there , ready to start , and he had only to take his seat in the car , an irresistible influence held him back . 
The station platform burned his feet , and he could not stir . 
The conflict in his mind again began ; anger and failure stifled him . 
He wished to struggle on to the end . 
Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded , among them Colonel Proctor , whose injuries were serious , had taken their places in the train . 
The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard , and the steam was escaping from the valves . 
The engineer whistled , the train started , and soon disappeared , mingling its white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snow . 
The detective had remained behind . 
Several hours passed . 
The weather was dismal , and it was very cold . 
Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station ; he might have been thought asleep . 
Aouda , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting-room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound . 
She heard and saw nothing . 
Then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain . 
Evening came , and the little band had not returned . 
Where could they be ? 
Had they found the Indians , and were they having a conflict with them , or were they still wandering amid the mist ? 
The commander of the fort was anxious , though he tried to conceal his apprehensions . 
As night approached , the snow fell less plentifully , but it became intensely cold . 
Absolute silence rested on the plains . 
Neither flight of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm . 
Throughout the night Aouda , full of sad forebodings , her heart stifled with anguish , wandered about on the verge of the plains . 
Her imagination carried her far off , and showed her innumerable dangers . 
What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to describe . 
Fix remained stationary in the same place , but did not sleep . 
Once a man approached and spoke to him , and the detective merely replied by shaking his head . 
Thus the night passed . 
At dawn , the half-extinguished disc of the sun rose above a misty horizon ; but it was now possible to recognise objects two miles off . 
Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward ; in the south all was still vacancy . 
It was then seven o'clock . 
The captain , who was really alarmed , did not know what course to take . 
Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first ? 
Should he sacrifice more men , with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed ? 
His hesitation did not last long , however . 
Calling one of his lieutenants , he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance , when gunshots were heard . 
Was it a signal ? 
The soldiers rushed out of the fort , and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in good order . 
Mr. Fogg was marching at their head , and just behind him were Passepartout and the other two travellers , rescued from the Sioux . 
They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney . 
Shortly before the detachment arrived , Passepartout and his companions had begun to struggle with their captors , three of whom the Frenchman had felled with his fists , when his master and the soldiers hastened up to their relief . 
All were welcomed with joyful cries . 
Phileas Fogg distributed the reward he had promised to the soldiers , while Passepartout , not without reason , muttered to himself , `` It must certainly be confessed that I cost my master dear ! '' 
Fix , without saying a word , looked at Mr. Fogg , and it would have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him . 
As for Aouda , she took her protector 's hand and pressed it in her own , too much moved to speak . 
Meanwhile , Passepartout was looking about for the train ; he thought he should find it there , ready to start for Omaha , and he hoped that the time lost might be regained . 
`` The train ! 
the train ! '' 
cried he . 
`` Gone , '' replied Fix . 
`` And when does the next train pass here ? '' 
said Phileas Fogg . 
`` Not till this evening . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
returned the impassible gentleman quietly . 
IN WHICH FIX , THE DETECTIVE , CONSIDERABLY FURTHERS THE INTERESTS OF PHILEAS FOGG Phileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time . 
Passepartout , the involuntary cause of this delay , was desperate . 
He had ruined his master ! 
At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg , and , looking him intently in the face , said : `` Seriously , sir , are you in great haste ? '' 
`` Quite seriously . '' 
`` I have a purpose in asking , '' resumed Fix . 
`` Is it absolutely necessary that you should be in New York on the 11th , before nine o'clock in the evening , the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool ? '' 
`` It is absolutely necessary . '' 
`` And , if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians , you would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th ? '' 
`` Yes ; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left . '' 
`` Good ! 
you are therefore twenty hours behind . 
Twelve from twenty leaves eight . 
You must regain eight hours . 
Do you wish to try to do so ? '' 
`` On foot ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` No ; on a sledge , '' replied Fix . 
`` On a sledge with sails . 
A man has proposed such a method to me . '' 
It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night , and whose offer he had refused . 
Phileas Fogg did not reply at once ; but Fix , having pointed out the man , who was walking up and down in front of the station , Mr. Fogg went up to him . 
An instant after , Mr. Fogg and the American , whose name was Mudge , entered a hut built just below the fort . 
There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . 
A high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . 
This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail . 
Behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . 
It was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . 
During the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . 
Provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains . 
Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft . 
The wind was favourable , being fresh , and blowing from the west . 
The snow had hardened , and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha . 
Thence the trains eastward run frequently to Chicago and New York . 
It was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered ; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected .
