It was the Jondrette girl . 
`` Is it you ? '' 
resumed Marius almost harshly , `` still you ! 
What do you want with me ? '' 
She appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him . 
She no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning . 
She did not enter , but held back in the darkness of the corridor , where Marius could see her through the half-open door . 
`` Come now , will you answer ? '' 
cried Marius . 
`` What do you want with me ? '' 
She raised her dull eyes , in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely , and said : -- `` Monsieur Marius , you look sad . 
What is the matter with you ? '' 
`` With me ! '' 
said Marius . 
`` Yes , you . '' 
`` There is nothing the matter with me . '' 
`` Yes , there is ! '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I tell you there is ! '' 
`` Let me alone ! '' 
Marius gave the door another push , but she retained her hold on it . 
`` Stop , '' said she , `` you are in the wrong . 
Although you are not rich , you were kind this morning . 
Be so again now . 
You gave me something to eat , now tell me what ails you . 
You are grieved , that is plain . 
I do not want you to be grieved . 
What can be done for it ? 
Can I be of any service ? 
Employ me . 
I do not ask for your secrets , you need not tell them to me , but I may be of use , nevertheless . 
I may be able to help you , since I help my father . 
When it is necessary to carry letters , to go to houses , to inquire from door to door , to find out an address , to follow any one , I am of service . 
Well , you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you , and I will go and speak to the persons ; sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons , that suffices to let them understand matters , and everything comes right . 
Make use of me . '' 
An idea flashed across Marius ' mind . 
What branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling ? 
He drew near to the Jondrette girl . 
`` Listen -- '' he said to her . 
She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes . 
`` Oh yes , do call me thou ! 
I like that better . '' 
`` Well , '' he resumed , `` thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his daughter ! '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Dost thou know their address ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Find it for me . '' 
The Jondrette 's dull eyes had grown joyous , and they now became gloomy . 
`` Is that what you want ? '' 
she demanded . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Do you know them ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` That is to say , '' she resumed quickly , `` you do not know her , but you wish to know her . '' 
This them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it . 
`` Well , can you do it ? '' 
said Marius . 
`` You shall have the beautiful lady 's address . '' 
There was still a shade in the words `` the beautiful lady '' which troubled Marius . 
He resumed : -- `` Never mind , after all , the address of the father and daughter . 
Their address , indeed ! '' 
She gazed fixedly at him . 
`` What will you give me ? '' 
`` Anything you like . '' 
`` Anything I like ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You shall have the address . '' 
She dropped her head ; then , with a brusque movement , she pulled to the door , which closed behind her . 
Marius found himself alone . 
He dropped into a chair , with his head and both elbows on his bed , absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp , and as though a prey to vertigo . 
All that had taken place since the morning , the appearance of the angel , her disappearance , what that creature had just said to him , a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair , -- this was what filled his brain confusedly . 
All at once he was violently aroused from his revery . 
He heard the shrill , hard voice of Jondrette utter these words , which were fraught with a strange interest for him : -- `` I tell you that I am sure of it , and that I recognized him . '' 
Of whom was Jondrette speaking ? 
Whom had he recognized ? 
M. Leblanc ? 
The father of `` his Ursule '' ? 
What ! 
Did Jondrette know him ? 
Was Marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him ? 
Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved , who that young girl was ? 
Who her father was ? 
Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled ? 
Was the veil about to be rent ? 
Ah ! 
Heavens ! 
He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode , and resumed his post near the little peep-hole in the partition wall . 
Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette 's hovel . 
THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC 'S FIVE-FRANC PIECE Nothing in the aspect of the family was altered , except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets . 
Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds . 
Jondrette had evidently just returned . 
He still had the breathlessness of out of doors . 
His daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace , the elder engaged in dressing the younger 's wounded hand . 
His wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace , with a face indicative of astonishment . 
Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides . 
His eyes were extraordinary . 
The woman , who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband , turned to say : -- `` What , really ? 
You are sure ? '' 
`` Sure ! 
Eight years have passed ! 
But I recognize him ! 
Ah ! 
I recognize him . 
I knew him at once ! 
What ! 
Did n't it force itself on you ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` But I told you : ` Pay attention ! ' 
Why , it is his figure , it is his face , only older , -- there are people who do not grow old , I do n't know how they manage it , -- it is the very sound of his voice . 
He is better dressed , that is all ! 
Ah ! 
you mysterious old devil , I 've got you , that I have ! '' 
He paused , and said to his daughters : -- `` Get out of here , you ! 
-- It 's queer that it did n't strike you ! '' 
They arose to obey . 
The mother stammered : -- `` With her injured hand . '' 
`` The air will do it good , '' said Jondrette . 
`` Be off . '' 
It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply . 
The two girls departed . 
At the moment when they were about to pass through the door , the father detained the elder by the arm , and said to her with a peculiar accent : -- `` You will be here at five o'clock precisely . 
Both of you . 
I shall need you . '' 
Marius redoubled his attention . 
On being left alone with his wife , Jondrette began to pace the room again , and made the tour of it two or three times in silence . 
Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman 's chemise which he wore into his trousers . 
All at once , he turned to the female Jondrette , folded his arms and exclaimed : -- `` And would you like to have me tell you something ? 
The young lady -- '' `` Well , what ? '' 
retorted his wife , `` the young lady ? '' 
Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking . 
He listened with ardent anxiety . 
His whole life was in his ears . 
But Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper . 
Then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud : -- `` It is she ! '' 
`` That one ? '' 
said his wife . 
`` That very one , '' said the husband . 
No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother 's words . 
Surprise , rage , hate , wrath , were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation . 
The pronunciation of a few words , the name , no doubt , which her husband had whispered in her ear , had sufficed to rouse this huge , somnolent woman , and from being repulsive she became terrible . 
`` It is not possible ! '' 
she cried . 
`` When I think that my daughters are going barefoot , and have not a gown to their backs ! 
What ! 
A satin pelisse , a velvet bonnet , boots , and everything ; more than two hundred francs ' worth of clothes ! 
so that one would think she was a lady ! 
No , you are mistaken ! 
Why , in the first place , the other was hideous , and this one is not so bad-looking ! 
She really is not bad-looking ! 
It ca n't be she ! '' 
`` I tell you that it is she . 
You will see . '' 
At this absolute assertion , the Jondrette woman raised her large , red , blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression . 
At that moment , she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her husband . 
She was a sow with the look of a tigress . 
`` What ! '' 
she resumed , `` that horrible , beautiful young lady , who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity , -- she is that beggar brat ! 
Oh ! 
I should like to kick her stomach in for her ! '' 
She sprang off of the bed , and remained standing for a moment , her hair in disorder , her nostrils dilating , her mouth half open , her fists clenched and drawn back . 
Then she fell back on the bed once more . 
The man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female . 
After a silence lasting several minutes , he approached the female Jondrette , and halted in front of her , with folded arms , as he had done a moment before : -- `` And shall I tell you another thing ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
she asked . 
He answered in a low , curt voice : -- `` My fortune is made . '' 
The woman stared at him with the look that signifies : `` Is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad ? '' 
He went on : -- `` Thunder ! 
It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the parish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire , - die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread ! 
I have had enough of misery ! 
my share and other people 's share ! 
I am not joking any longer , I do n't find it comic any more , I 've had enough of puns , good God ! 
no more farces , Eternal Father ! 
I want to eat till I am full , I want to drink my fill ! 
to gormandize ! 
to sleep ! 
to do nothing ! 
I want to have my turn , so I do , come now ! 
before I die ! 
I want to be a bit of a millionnaire ! '' 
He took a turn round the hovel , and added : -- `` Like other people . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
asked the woman . 
He shook his head , winked , screwed up one eye , and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration : -- `` What do I mean by that ? 
Listen ! '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
muttered the woman , `` not so loud ! 
These are matters which must not be overheard . '' 
`` Bah ! 
Who 's here ? 
Our neighbor ? 
I saw him go out a little while ago . 
Besides , he does n't listen , the big booby . 
And I tell you that I saw him go out . '' 
Nevertheless , by a sort of instinct , Jondrette lowered his voice , although not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words . 
One favorable circumstance , which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard . 
This is what Marius heard : -- `` Listen carefully . 
The Croesus is caught , or as good as caught ! 
That 's all settled already . 
Everything is arranged . 
I have seen some people . 
He will come here this evening at six o'clock . 
To bring sixty francs , the rascal ! 
Did you notice how I played that game on him , my sixty francs , my landlord , my fourth of February ? 
I do n't even owe for one quarter ! 
Is n't he a fool ! 
So he will come at six o'clock ! 
That 's the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner . 
Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in the city . 
There 's not a soul in the house . 
The neighbor never comes home until eleven o'clock . 
The children shall stand on watch . 
You shall help us . 
He will give in . '' 
`` And what if he does not give in ? '' 
demanded his wife . 
Jondrette made a sinister gesture , and said : -- `` We 'll fix him . '' 
And he burst out laughing . 
This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh . 
The laugh was cold and sweet , and provoked a shudder . 
Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace , and drew from it an old cap , which he placed on his head , after brushing it with his sleeve . 
`` Now , '' said he , `` I 'm going out . 
I have some more people that I must see . 
Good ones . 
You 'll see how well the whole thing will work . 
I shall be away as short a time as possible , it 's a fine stroke of business , do you look after the house . '' 
And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers , he stood for a moment in thought , then exclaimed : -- `` Do you know , it 's mighty lucky , by the way , that he did n't recognize me ! 
If he had recognized me on his side , he would not have come back again . 
He would have slipped through our fingers ! 
It was my beard that saved us ! 
my romantic beard ! 
my pretty little romantic beard ! '' 
And again he broke into a laugh . 
He stepped to the window . 
The snow was still falling , and streaking the gray of the sky . 
`` What beastly weather ! '' 
said he . 
Then lapping his overcoat across his breast : -- `` This rind is too large for me . 
Never mind , '' he added , `` he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me , the old scoundrel ! 
If it had n't been for that , I could n't have gone out , and everything would have gone wrong ! 
What small points things hang on , anyway ! '' 
And pulling his cap down over his eyes , he quitted the room . 
He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door , when the door opened again , and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening . 
`` I came near forgetting , '' said he . 
`` You are to have a brazier of charcoal ready . '' 
And he flung into his wife 's apron the five-franc piece which the `` philanthropist '' had left with him . 
`` A brazier of charcoal ? '' 
asked his wife . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` How many bushels ? '' 
`` Two good ones . '' 
`` That will come to thirty sous . 
With the rest I will buy something for dinner . '' 
`` The devil , no . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Do n't go and spend the hundred-sou piece . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because I shall have to buy something , too . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Something . '' 
`` How much shall you need ? '' 
`` Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger 's shop ? '' 
`` Rue Mouffetard . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , at the corner of a street ; I can see the shop . '' 
`` But tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase ? '' 
`` Fifty sous -- three francs . '' 
`` There wo n't be much left for dinner . '' 
`` Eating is not the point to-day . 
There 's something better to be done . '' 
`` That 's enough , my jewel . '' 
At this word from his wife , Jondrette closed the door again , and this time , Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel , and descend the staircase rapidly . 
At that moment , one o'clock struck from the church of Saint-Medard . 
SOLUS CUM SOLO , IN LOCO REMOTO , NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE PATER NOSTER Marius , dreamer as he was , was , as we have said , firm and energetic by nature . 
His habits of solitary meditation , while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion , had , perhaps , diminished the faculty for irritation , but had left intact the power of waxing indignant ; he had the kindliness of a brahmin , and the severity of a judge ; he took pity upon a toad , but he crushed a viper . 
Now , it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed , it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes . 
`` These wretches must be stamped upon , '' said he . 
Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated ; on the contrary , all of them had been rendered more dense , if anything ; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the Luxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc , except that Jondrette was acquainted with them . 
Athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered , the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation , a dark but terrible trap ; that both of them were incurring great danger , she probably , her father certainly ; that they must be saved ; that the hideous plots of the Jondrettes must be thwarted , and the web of these spiders broken . 
He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment . 
She had pulled an old sheet-iron stove from a corner , and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron . 
He descended from the commode as softly as possible , taking care not to make the least noise . 
Amid his terror as to what was in preparation , and in the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him , he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved . 
But how was it to be done ? 
How warn the persons threatened ? 
He did not know their address . 
They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes , and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris . 
Should he wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o'clock , at the moment of his arrival , and warn him of the trap ? 
But Jondrette and his men would see him on the watch , the spot was lonely , they were stronger than he , they would devise means to seize him or to get him away , and the man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost . 
One o'clock had just struck , the trap was to be sprung at six . 
Marius had five hours before him . 
There was but one thing to be done . 
He put on his decent coat , knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck , took his hat , and went out , without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet . 
Moreover , the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron . 
Once outside of the house , he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier . 
He had almost reached the middle of this street , near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points , and which abuts on a waste space , and was walking slowly , in consequence of his preoccupied condition , and the snow deadened the sound of his steps ; all at once he heard voices talking very close by . 
He turned his head , the street was deserted , there was not a soul in it , it was broad daylight , and yet he distinctly heard voices . 
It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting . 
There , in fact , sat two men , flat on the snow , with their backs against the wall , talking together in subdued tones . 
These two persons were strangers to him ; one was a bearded man in a blouse , and the other a long-haired individual in rags . 
The bearded man had on a fez , the other 's head was bare , and the snow had lodged in his hair . 
By thrusting his head over the wall , Marius could hear their remarks . 
The hairy one jogged the other man 's elbow and said : -- '' -- With the assistance of Patron-Minette , it ca n't fail . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
said the bearded man . 
And the long-haired one began again : -- `` It 's as good as a warrant for each one , of five hundred balls , and the worst that can happen is five years , six years , ten years at the most ! '' 
The other replied with some hesitation , and shivering beneath his fez : -- `` That 's a real thing . 
You ca n't go against such things . '' 
`` I tell you that the affair ca n't go wrong , '' resumed the long-haired man . 
`` Father What 's - his-name 's team will be already harnessed . '' 
Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the Gaite Theatre . 
Marius went his way . 
It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men , so strangely hidden behind that wall , and crouching in the snow , could not but bear some relation to Jondrette 's abominable projects . 
That must be the affair . 
He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police . 
He was directed to Rue de Pontoise , No. 14 . 
Thither Marius betook himself . 
As he passed a baker 's shop , he bought a two-penny roll , and ate it , foreseeing that he should not dine . 
On the way , he rendered justice to Providence . 
He reflected that had he not given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning , he would have followed M. Leblanc 's fiacre , and consequently have remained ignorant of everything , and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost , and his daughter with him , no doubt . 
IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER On arriving at No. 14 , Rue de Pontoise , he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police . 
`` The commissary of police is not here , '' said a clerk ; `` but there is an inspector who takes his place . 
Would you like to speak to him ? 
Are you in haste ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Marius . 
The clerk introduced him into the commissary 's office . 
There stood a tall man behind a grating , leaning against a stove , and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat , with three collars . 
His face was square , with a thin , firmmouth , thick , gray , and very ferocious whiskers , and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out . 
Of that glance it might have been well said , not that it penetrated , but that it searched . 
This man 's air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than Jondrette 's ; the dog is , at times , no less terrible to meet than the wolf . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
he said to Marius , without adding `` monsieur . '' 
`` Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police ? '' 
`` He is absent . 
I am here in his stead . '' 
`` The matter is very private . '' ' 
`` Then speak . '' 
`` And great haste is required . '' 
`` Then speak quick . '' 
This calm , abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time . 
He inspired fear and confidence . 
Marius related the adventure to him : That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight , was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening ; that , as he occupied the room adjoining the den , he , Marius Pontmercy , a lawyer , had heard the whole plot through the partition ; that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette ; that there would be accomplices , probably some prowlers of the barriers , among others a certain Panchaud , alias Printanier , alias Bigrenaille ; that Jondrette 's daughters were to lie in wait ; that there was no way of warning the threatened man , since he did not even know his name ; and that , finally , all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening , at the most deserted point of the Boulevard de l'Hopital , in house No. 50-52 . 
At the sound of this number , the inspector raised his head , and said coldly : -- `` So it is in the room at the end of the corridor ? '' 
`` Precisely , '' answered Marius , and he added : `` Are you acquainted with that house ? '' 
The inspector remained silent for a moment , then replied , as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove : -- `` Apparently . '' 
He went on , muttering between his teeth , and not addressing Marius so much as his cravat : -- `` Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this . '' 
This word struck Marius . 
`` Patron-Minette , '' said he , `` I did hear that word pronounced , in fact . '' 
And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du Petit-Banquier . 
The inspector muttered : -- `` The long-haired man must be Brujon , and the bearded one Demi-Liard , alias Deux-Milliards . '' 
He had dropped his eyelids again , and became absorbed in thought . 
`` As for Father What 's - his-name , I think I recognize him . 
Here , I 've burned my coat . 
They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves . 
Number 50-52 . 
Former property of Gorbeau . '' 
Then he glanced at Marius . 
`` You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man ? '' 
`` And Panchaud . '' 
`` You did n't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Nor a big lump of matter , resembling an elephant in the Jardin des Plantes ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` As for the fourth , no one sees him , not even his adjutants , clerks , and employees . 
It is not surprising that you did not see him . '' 
`` No . 
Who are all those persons ? '' 
asked Marius . 
The inspector answered : -- `` Besides , this is not the time for them . '' 
He relapsed into silence , then resumed : -- `` 50-52 . 
I know that barrack . 
Impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us , and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville . 
They are so modest ! 
An audience embarrasses them . 
None of that , none of that . 
I want to hear them sing and make them dance . '' 
This monologue concluded , he turned to Marius , and demanded , gazing at him intently the while : -- `` Are you afraid ? '' 
`` Of what ? '' 
said Marius . 
`` Of these men ? '' 
`` No more than yourself ! '' 
retorted Marius rudely , who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said `` monsieur '' to him . 
The inspector stared still more intently at Marius , and continued with sententious solemnity : -- `` There , you speak like a brave man , and like an honest man . 
Courage does not fear crime , and honesty does not fear authority . '' 
Marius interrupted him : -- `` That is well , but what do you intend to do ? '' 
The inspector contented himself with the remark : -- `` The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night . 
You must have one . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Marius . 
`` Have you it about you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Give it to me , '' said the inspector . 
Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket , handed it to the inspector and added : -- `` If you will take my advice , you will come in force . '' 
The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him ; with one movement he plunged his hands , which were enormous , into the two immense pockets of his top-coat , and pulled out two small steel pistols , of the sort called `` knock-me-downs . '' 
Then he presented them to Marius , saying rapidly , in a curt tone : -- `` Take these . 
Go home . 
Hide in your chamber , so that you may be supposed to have gone out . 
They are loaded . 
Each one carries two balls . 
You will keep watch ; there is a hole in the wall , as you have informed me . 
These men will come . 
Leave them to their own devices for a time . 
When you think matters have reached a crisis , and that it is time to put a stop to them , fire a shot . 
Not too soon . 
The rest concerns me . 
A shot into the ceiling , the air , no matter where . 
Above all things , not too soon . 
Wait until they begin to put their project into execution ; you are a lawyer ; you know the proper point . '' 
Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat . 
`` That makes a lump that can be seen , '' said the inspector . 
`` Put them in your trousers pocket . '' 
Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets . 
`` Now , '' pursued the inspector , `` there is not a minute more to be lost by any one . 
What time is it ? 
Half-past two . 
Seven o'clock is the hour ? '' 
`` Six o'clock , '' answered Marius . 
`` I have plenty of time , '' said the inspector , `` but no more than enough . 
Do n't forget anything that I have said to you . 
Bang . 
A pistol shot . '' 
`` Rest easy , '' said Marius . 
And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out , the inspector called to him : -- `` By the way , if you have occasion for my services between now and then , come or send here . 
You will ask for Inspector Javert . '' 
JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES A few moments later , about three o'clock , Courfeyrac chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet . 
The snow had redoubled in violence , and filled the air . 
Bossuet was just saying to Courfeyrac : -- `` One would say , to see all these snow-flakes fall , that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven . '' 
All at once , Bossuet caught sight of Marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air . 
`` Hold ! '' 
said Bossuet . 
`` There 's Marius . '' 
`` I saw him , '' said Courfeyrac . 
`` Do n't let 's speak to him . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` He is busy . '' 
`` With what ? '' 
`` Do n't you see his air ? '' 
`` What air ? '' 
`` He has the air of a man who is following some one . '' 
`` That 's true , '' said Bossuet . 
`` Just see the eyes he is making ! '' 
said Courfeyrac . 
`` But who the deuce is he following ? '' 
`` Some fine , flowery bonneted wench ! 
He 's in love . '' 
`` But , '' observed Bossuet , `` I do n't see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street . 
There 's not a woman round . '' 
Courfeyrac took a survey , and exclaimed : -- `` He 's following a man ! '' 
A man , in fact , wearing a gray cap , and whose gray beard could be distinguished , although they only saw his back , was walking along about twenty paces in advance of Marius . 
This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too large for him , and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud . 
Bossuet burst out laughing . 
`` Who is that man ? '' 
`` He ? '' 
retorted Courfeyrac , `` he 's a poet . 
Poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of France . '' 
`` Let 's see where Marius will go , '' said Bossuet ; `` let 's see where the man is going , let 's follow them , hey ? '' 
`` Bossuet ! '' 
exclaimed Courfeyrac , `` eagle of Meaux ! 
You are a prodigious brute . 
Follow a man who is following another man , indeed ! '' 
They retraced their steps . 
Marius had , in fact , seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard , and was spying on his proceedings . 
Jondrette walked straight ahead , without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance . 
He quitted the Rue Mouffetard , and Marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse ; he remained there about a quarter of an hour , then returned to the Rue Mouffetard . 
He halted at an ironmonger 's shop , which then stood at the corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard , and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop , holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle , which he concealed beneath his great-coat . 
At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier . 
The day was declining ; the snow , which had ceased for a moment , had just begun again . 
Marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier , which was deserted , as usual , and did not follow Jondrette into it . 
It was lucky that he did so , for , on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing , Jondrette turned round , made sure that no one was following him , did not see him , then sprang across the wall and disappeared . 
The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of an ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute , who had failed and who still kept a few old single-seated berlins under his sheds . 
Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette 's absence to return home ; moreover , it was growing late ; every evening , Ma'am Bougon when she set out for her dish-washing in town , had a habit of locking the door , which was always closed at dusk . 
Marius had given his key to the inspector of police ; it was important , therefore , that he should make haste . 
Evening had arrived , night had almost closed in ; on the horizon and in the immensity of space , there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun , and that was the moon . 
It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpetriere . 
Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides . 
The door was still open when he arrived . 
He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber . 
This corridor , as the reader will remember , was bordered on both sides by attics , all of which were , for the moment , empty and to let . 
Ma'am Bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open . 
As he passed one of these attics , Marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men , vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight , falling through a dormer window , Marius made no attempt to see , not wishing to be seen himself . 
He succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise . 
It was high time . 
A moment later he heard Ma'am Bougon take her departure , locking the door of the house behind her . 
IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH WAS IN FASHION IN 1832 Marius seated himself on his bed . 
It might have been half-past five o'clock . 
Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen . 
He heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark . 
He thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the dark , -- crime advancing on one side , justice coming up on the other . 
He was not afraid , but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place . 
As is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure , the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream , and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare , he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets . 
It was no longer snowing ; the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist , and its light , mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen , communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect . 
There was a light in the Jondrette den . 
Marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him . 
It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle . 
However , there was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters , not a soul was moving there , not a soul speaking , not a breath ; the silence was glacial and profound , and had it not been for that light , he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre . 
Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed . 
Several minutes elapsed . 
Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges ; a heavy step mounted the staircase , and hastened along the corridor ; the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted ; it was Jondrette returning . 
Instantly , several voices arose .
