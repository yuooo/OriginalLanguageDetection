She was happy ; above all she was stupefied . 
Such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real . 
The doll frightened her , the gold piece frightened her . 
She trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence . 
The stranger alone did not frighten her . 
On the contrary , he reassured her . 
Ever since the preceding evening , amid all her amazement , even in her sleep , she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad , and who was so rich and so kind . 
Everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest . 
Cosette , less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven , had never known what it was to take refuge under a mother 's shadow and under a wing . 
For the last five years , that is to say , as far back as her memory ran , the poor child had shivered and trembled . 
She had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity ; now it seemed to her she was clothed . 
Formerly her soul had seemed cold , now it was warm . 
Cosette was no longer afraid of the Thenardier . 
She was no longer alone ; there was some one there . 
She hastily set about her regular morning duties . 
That louis , which she had about her , in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece had fallen on the night before , distracted her thoughts . 
She dared not touch it , but she spent five minutes in gazing at it , with her tongue hanging out , if the truth must be told . 
As she swept the staircase , she paused , remained standing there motionless , forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe , occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket . 
It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thenardier joined her . 
She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband 's orders . 
What was quite unprecedented , she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her . 
`` Cosette , '' she said , almost gently , `` come immediately . '' 
An instant later Cosette entered the public room . 
The stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it . 
This bundle contained a little woollen gown , an apron , a fustian bodice , a kerchief , a petticoat , woollen stockings , shoes -- a complete outfit for a girl of seven years . 
All was black . 
`` My child , '' said the man , `` take these , and go and dress yourself quickly . '' 
Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning , and carrying a pink doll in her arms , pass along the road to Paris . 
They were going in the direction of Livry . 
It was our man and Cosette . 
No one knew the man ; as Cosette was no longer in rags , many did not recognize her . 
Cosette was going away . 
With whom ? 
She did not know . 
Whither ? 
She knew not . 
All that she understood was that she was leaving the Thenardier tavern behind her . 
No one had thought of bidding her farewell , nor had she thought of taking leave of any one . 
She was leaving that hated and hating house . 
Poor , gentle creature , whose heart had been repressed up to that hour ! 
Cosette walked along gravely , with her large eyes wide open , and gazing at the sky . 
She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron . 
From time to time , she bent down and glanced at it ; then she looked at the good man . 
She felt something as though she were beside the good God . 
HE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATION WORSE Madame Thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way , as was her wont . 
She had expected great results . 
When the man and Cosette had taken their departure , Thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse ; then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs . 
`` Is that all ? '' 
said she . 
It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the master 's acts . 
The blow told . 
`` You are right , in sooth , '' said he ; `` I am a fool . 
Give me my hat . '' 
He folded up the three bank-bills , thrust them into his pocket , and ran out in all haste ; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first . 
Some neighbors , of whom he made inquiries , put him on the track again ; the Lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry . 
He followed these hints , walking with great strides , and talking to himself the while : -- `` That man is evidently a million dressed in yellow , and I am an animal . 
First he gave twenty sous , then five francs , then fifty francs , then fifteen hundred francs , all with equal readiness . 
He would have given fifteen thousand francs . 
But I shall overtake him . '' 
And then , that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child ; all that was singular ; many mysteries lay concealed under it . 
One does not let mysteries out of one 's hand when one has once grasped them . 
The secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold ; one must know how to subject them to pressure . 
All these thoughts whirled through his brain . 
`` I am an animal , '' said he . 
When one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to Livry , it can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau . 
On arriving there , he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child . 
He looked as far as his vision reached , and saw nothing . 
He made fresh inquiries , but he had wasted time . 
Some passers-by informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of Gagny . 
He hastened in that direction . 
They were far in advance of him ; but a child walks slowly , and he walked fast ; and then , he was well acquainted with the country . 
All at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps . 
`` I ought to have taken my gun , '' said he to himself . 
Thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact , and who disappear without our finding them out , because destiny has only exhibited one side of them . 
It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged . 
In a calm and even situation , Thenardier possessed all that is required to make -- we will not say to be -- what people have agreed to call an honest trader , a good bourgeois . 
At the same time certain circumstances being given , certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the surface , he had all the requisites for a blackguard . 
He was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster . 
Satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which Thenardier dwelt , and have fallen a-dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece . 
After a momentary hesitation : -- `` Bah ! '' 
he thought ; `` they will have time to make their escape . '' 
And he pursued his road , walking rapidly straight ahead , and with almost an air of certainty , with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges . 
In truth , when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue de Bellevue , and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill , and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey of Chelles , he caught sight , over the top of the brushwood , of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures ; it was that man 's hat . 
The brushwood was not high . 
Thenardier recognized the fact that the man and Cosette were sitting there . 
The child could not be seen on account of her small size , but the head of her doll was visible . 
Thenardier was not mistaken . 
The man was sitting there , and letting Cosette get somewhat rested . 
The inn-keeper walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of . 
`` Pardon , excuse me , sir , '' he said , quite breathless , `` but here are your fifteen hundred francs . '' 
So saying , he handed the stranger the three bank-bills . 
The man raised his eyes . 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
Thenardier replied respectfully : -- `` It means , sir , that I shall take back Cosette . '' 
Cosette shuddered , and pressed close to the old man . 
He replied , gazing to the very bottom of Thenardier 's eyes the while , and enunciating every syllable distinctly : -- `` You are go-ing to take back Co-sette ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , I am . 
I will tell you ; I have considered the matter . 
In fact , I have not the right to give her to you . 
I am an honest man , you see ; this child does not belong to me ; she belongs to her mother . 
It was her mother who confided her to me ; I can only resign her to her mother . 
You will say to me , ` But her mother is dead . ' 
Good ; in that case I can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing , signed by her mother , to the effect that I am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned ; that is clear . '' 
The man , without making any reply , fumbled in his pocket , and Thenardier beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more . 
The tavern-keeper shivered with joy . 
`` Good ! '' 
thought he ; `` let us hold firm ; he is going to bribe me ! '' 
Before opening the pocket-book , the traveller cast a glance about him : the spot was absolutely deserted ; there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley . 
The man opened his pocket-book once more and drew from it , not the handful of bills which Thenardier expected , but a simple little paper , which he unfolded and presented fully open to the inn-keeper , saying : -- `` You are right ; read ! '' 
Thenardier took the paper and read : -- `` M. SUR M. , March 25 , 1823 . 
`` MONSIEUR THENARDIER : -- You will deliver Cosette to this person . 
You will be paid for all the little things . 
I have the honor to salute you with respect , FANTINE . '' 
`` You know that signature ? '' 
resumed the man . 
It certainly was Fantine 's signature ; Thenardier recognized it . 
There was no reply to make ; he experienced two violent vexations , the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for , and the vexation of being beaten ; the man added : -- `` You may keep this paper as your receipt . '' 
Thenardier retreated in tolerably good order . 
`` This signature is fairly well imitated , '' he growled between his teeth ; `` however , let it go ! '' 
Then he essayed a desperate effort . 
`` It is well , sir , '' he said , `` since you are the person , but I must be paid for all those little things . 
A great deal is owing to me . '' 
The man rose to his feet , filliping the dust from his thread-bare sleeve : -- `` Monsieur Thenardier , in January last , the mother reckoned that she owed you one hundred and twenty francs . 
In February , you sent her a bill of five hundred francs ; you received three hundred francs at the end of February , and three hundred francs at the beginning of March . 
Since then nine months have elapsed , at fifteen francs a month , the price agreed upon , which makes one hundred and thirty-five francs . 
You had received one hundred francs too much ; that makes thirty-five still owing you . 
I have just given you fifteen hundred francs . '' 
Thenardier 's sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap . 
`` Who is this devil of a man ? '' 
he thought . 
He did what the wolf does : he shook himself . 
Audacity had succeeded with him once . 
`` Monsieur-I-don ` t-know-your-name , '' he said resolutely , and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony , `` I shall take back Cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns . '' 
The stranger said tranquilly : -- `` Come , Cosette . '' 
He took Cosette by his left hand , and with his right he picked up his cudgel , which was lying on the ground . 
Thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot . 
The man plunged into the forest with the child , leaving the inn-keeper motionless and speechless . 
While they were walking away , Thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders , which were a little rounded , and his great fists . 
Then , bringing his eyes back to his own person , they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands . 
`` I really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun , '' he said to himself , `` since I was going hunting ! '' 
However , the inn-keeper did not give up . 
`` I want to know where he is going , '' said he , and he set out to follow them at a distance . 
Two things were left on his hands , an irony in the shape of the paper signed Fantine , and a consolation , the fifteen hundred francs . 
The man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry and Bondy . 
He walked slowly , with drooping head , in an attitude of reflection and sadness . 
The winter had thinned out the forest , so that Thenardier did not lose them from sight , although he kept at a good distance . 
The man turned round from time to time , and looked to see if he was being followed . 
All at once he caught sight of Thenardier . 
He plunged suddenly into the brushwood with Cosette , where they could both hide themselves . 
`` The deuce ! '' 
said Thenardier , and he redoubled his pace . 
The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them . 
When the man had reached the densest part of the thicket , he wheeled round . 
It was in vain that Thenardier sought to conceal himself in the branches ; he could not prevent the man seeing him . 
The man cast upon him an uneasy glance , then elevated his head and continued his course . 
The inn-keeper set out again in pursuit . 
Thus they continued for two or three hundred paces . 
All at once the man turned round once more ; he saw the inn-keeper . 
This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that Thenardier decided that it was `` useless '' to proceed further . 
Thenardier retraced his steps . 
NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS , AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERY Jean Valjean was not dead . 
When he fell into the sea , or rather , when he threw himself into it , he was not ironed , as we have seen . 
He swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor , to which a boat was moored . 
He found means of hiding himself in this boat until night . 
At night he swam off again , and reached the shore a little way from Cape Brun . 
There , as he did not lack money , he procured clothing . 
A small country-house in the neighborhood of Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts , -- a lucrative specialty . 
Then Jean Valjean , like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality , pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary . 
He found his first refuge at Pradeaux , near Beausset . 
Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard , near Briancon , in the Hautes-Alpes . 
It was a fumbling and uneasy flight , -- a mole 's track , whose branchings are untraceable . 
Later on , some trace of his passage into Ain , in the territory of Civrieux , was discovered ; in the Pyrenees , at Accons ; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec , near the market of Chavailles , and in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies , canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet . 
He reached Paris . 
We have just seen him at Montfermeil . 
His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age ; then to procure a lodging . 
That done , he had betaken himself to Montfermeil . 
It will be remembered that already , during his preceding escape , he had made a mysterious trip thither , or somewhere in that neighborhood , of which the law had gathered an inkling . 
However , he was thought to be dead , and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him . 
At Paris , one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands . 
He felt reassured and almost at peace , as though he had really been dead . 
On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the claws of the Thenardiers , he returned to Paris . 
He re-entered it at nightfall , with the child , by way of the Barrier Monceaux . 
There he entered a cabriolet , which took him to the esplanade of the Observatoire . 
There he got out , paid the coachman , took Cosette by the hand , and together they directed their steps through the darkness , -- through the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the Glaciere , towards the Boulevard de l'Hopital . 
The day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette . 
They had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns , behind hedges ; they had changed carriages frequently ; they had travelled short distances on foot . 
She made no complaint , but she was weary , and Jean Valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as she walked . 
He took her on his back . 
Cosette , without letting go of Catherine , laid her head on Jean Valjean 's shoulder , and there fell asleep . 
MASTER GORBEAU Forty years ago , a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the Salpetriere , and who had mounted to the Barriere d'Italie by way of the boulevard , reached a point where it might be said that Paris disappeared . 
It was no longer solitude , for there were passers-by ; it was not the country , for there were houses and streets ; it was not the city , for the streets had ruts like highways , and the grass grew in them ; it was not a village , the houses were too lofty . 
What was it , then ? 
It was an inhabited spot where there was no one ; it was a desert place where there was some one ; it was a boulevard of the great city , a street of Paris ; more wild at night than the forest , more gloomy by day than a cemetery . 
It was the old quarter of the Marche-aux-Chevaux . 
The rambler , if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this Marche-aux-Chevaux ; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue du Petit-Banquier , after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls ; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaver huts ; then an enclosure encumbered with timber , with a heap of stumps , sawdust , and shavings , on which stood a large dog , barking ; then a long , low , utterly dilapidated wall , with a little black door in mourning , laden with mosses , which were covered with flowers in the spring ; then , in the most deserted spot , a frightful and decrepit building , on which ran the inscription in large letters : POST NO BILLS , -- this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel . 
There , near a factory , and between two garden walls , there could be seen , at that epoch , a mean building , which , at the first glance , seemed as small as a thatched hovel , and which was , in reality , as large as a cathedral . 
It presented its side and gable to the public road ; hence its apparent diminutiveness . 
Nearly the whole of the house was hidden . 
Only the door and one window could be seen . 
This hovel was only one story high . 
The first detail that struck the observer was , that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel , while the window , if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry , might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion . 
The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly bound together by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs . 
It opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps , muddy , chalky , plaster-stained , dusty steps , of the same width as itself , which could be seen from the street , running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls . 
The top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed , which served both as wicket and air-hole when the door was closed . 
On the inside of the door the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink , and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number 50 , so that one hesitated . 
Where was one ? 
Above the door it said , `` Number 50 '' ; the inside replied , `` no , Number 52 . '' 
No one knows what dust-colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening . 
The window was large , sufficiently elevated , garnished with Venetian blinds , and with a frame in large square panes ; only these large panes were suffering from various wounds , which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage . 
And the blinds , dislocated and unpasted , threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants . 
The horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly ; so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter . 
This door with an unclean , and this window with an honest though dilapidated air , thus beheld on the same house , produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side , with different miens beneath the same rags , the one having always been a mendicant , and the other having once been a gentleman . 
The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house . 
This edifice had , for its intestinal tube , a long corridor , on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances , and rather more like stalls than cells . 
These chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood . 
All this was dark , disagreeable , wan , melancholy , sepulchral ; traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door , by cold rays or by icy winds . 
An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders . 
To the left of the entrance door , on the boulevard side , at about the height of a man from the ground , a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by . 
A portion of this building has recently been demolished . 
From what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days . 
As a whole , it was not over a hundred years old . 
A hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house . 
It seems as though man 's lodging partook of his ephemeral character , and God 's house of his eternity . 
The postmen called the house Number 50-52 ; but it was known in the neighborhood as the Gorbeau house . 
Let us explain whence this appellation was derived . 
Collectors of petty details , who become herbalists of anecdotes , and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin , know that there was in Paris , during the last century , about 1770 , two attorneys at the Chatelet named , one Corbeau -LRB- Raven -RRB- , the other Renard -LRB- Fox -RRB- . 
The two names had been forestalled by La Fontaine . 
The opportunity was too fine for the lawyers ; they made the most of it . 
A parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the court-house , in verses that limped a little : -- Maitre Corbeau , sur un dossier perche , -LSB- 13 -RSB- Tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire ; Maitre Renard , par l'odeur alleche , Lui fit a peu pres cette histoire : He ! 
bonjour . 
Etc. -LSB- 13 -RSB- Lawyer Corbeau , perched on a docket , held in his beak a writ of execution ; Lawyer Renard , attracted by the smell , addressed him nearly as follows , etc. . 
The two honest practitioners , embarrassed by the jests , and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them , resolved to get rid of their names , and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king . 
Their petition was presented to Louis XV . 
on the same day when the Papal Nuncio , on the one hand , and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on the other , both devoutly kneeling , were each engaged in putting on , in his Majesty 's presence , a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry , who had just got out of bed . 
The king , who was laughing , continued to laugh , passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers , and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names , or nearly so . 
By the kings command , Maitre Corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself Gorbeau . 
Maitre Renard was less lucky ; all he obtained was leave to place a P in front of his R , and to call himself Prenard ; so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first . 
Now , according to local tradition , this Maitre Gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de l'Hopital . 
He was even the author of the monumental window . 
Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house . 
Opposite this house , among the trees of the boulevard , rose a great elm which was three-quarters dead ; almost directly facing it opens the Rue de la Barriere des Gobelins , a street then without houses , unpaved , planted with unhealthy trees , which was green or muddy according to the season , and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris . 
An odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory . 
The barrier was close at hand . 
In 1823 the city wall was still in existence . 
This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind . 
It was the road to Bicetre . 
It was through it that , under the Empire and the Restoration , prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of their execution . 
It was there , that , about 1829 , was committed that mysterious assassination , called `` The assassination of the Fontainebleau barrier , '' whose authors justice was never able to discover ; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated , a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled . 
Take a few steps , and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe , where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder , as in the melodramas . 
A few paces more , and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the Barriere Saint-Jacques , that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold , that miserable and shameful Place de Grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society , which recoiled before the death penalty , neither daring to abolish it with grandeur , nor to uphold it with authority . 
Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques , which was , as it were , predestined , and which has always been horrible , probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard , seven and thirty years ago , was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive , where stood the building Number 50-52 . 
Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later . 
The place was unpleasant . 
In addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there , one was conscious of being between the Salpetriere , a glimpse of whose dome could be seen , and Bicetre , whose outskirts one was fairly touching ; that is to say , between the madness of women and the madness of men . 
As far as the eye could see , one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs , the city wall , and the fronts of a few factories , resembling barracks or monasteries ; everywhere about stood hovels , rubbish , ancient walls blackened like cerecloths , new white walls like winding-sheets ; everywhere parallel rows of trees , buildings erected on a line , flat constructions , long , cold rows , and the melancholy sadness of right angles . 
Not an unevenness of the ground , not a caprice in the architecture , not a fold . 
The ensemble was glacial , regular , hideous . 
Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry . 
It is because symmetry is ennui , and ennui is at the very foundation of grief . 
Despair yawns . 
Something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined , and that is a hell where one is bored . 
If such a hell existed , that bit of the Boulevard de l'Hopital might have formed the entrance to it . 
Nevertheless , at nightfall , at the moment when the daylight is vanishing , especially in winter , at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves , when the darkness is deep and starless , or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows , this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful . 
The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades , like morsels of the infinite . 
The passer-by can not refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet . 
The solitude of this spot , where so many crimes have been committed , had something terrible about it . 
One almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness ; all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious , and the long , hollow square , of which one caught a glimpse between each tree , seemed graves : by day it was ugly ; in the evening melancholy ; by night it was sinister . 
In summer , at twilight , one saw , here and there , a few old women seated at the foot of the elm , on benches mouldy with rain . 
These good old women were fond of begging . 
However , this quarter , which had a superannuated rather than an antique air , was tending even then to transformation . 
Even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste . 
Each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing . 
For the last twenty years the station of the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it , as it does to-day . 
Wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital , a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city . 
It seems as though , around these great centres of the movements of a people , the earth , full of germs , trembled and yawned , to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth , at the rattle of these powerful machines , at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire . 
The old houses crumble and new ones rise . 
Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpetriere , the ancient , narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the Jardin des Plantes tremble , as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which , in a given time , crowd back the houses to the right and the left ; for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact ; and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow , it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets . 
The symptoms of a new life are evident . 
In this old provincial quarter , in the wildest nooks , the pavement shows itself , the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer , even where there are as yet no pedestrians . 
One morning , -- a memorable morning in July , 1845 , -- black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there ; on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the Rue de l'Ourcine , and that Paris had entered the suburb of Saint-Marceau . 
A NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLER It was in front of this Gorbeau house that Jean Valjean halted . 
Like wild birds , he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest . 
He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket , drew out a sort of a pass-key , opened the door , entered , closed it again carefully , and ascended the staircase , still carrying Cosette . 
At the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key , with which he opened another door . 
The chamber which he entered , and which he closed again instantly , was a kind of moderately spacious attic , furnished with a mattress laid on the floor , a table , and several chairs ; a stove in which a fire was burning , and whose embers were visible , stood in one corner . 
A lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room . 
At the extreme end there was a dressing-room with a folding bed ; Jean Valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her . 
He struck a match and lighted a candle . 
All this was prepared beforehand on the table , and , as he had done on the previous evening , he began to scrutinize Cosette 's face with a gaze full of ecstasy , in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration . 
The little girl , with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness , had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was , and continued to sleep without knowing where she was . 
Jean Valjean bent down and kissed that child 's hand . 
Nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother , who had also just fallen asleep . 
The same sad , piercing , religious sentiment filled his heart . 
He knelt beside Cosette 's bed . 
lt was broad daylight , and the child still slept . 
A wan ray of the December sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade . 
All at once a heavily laden carrier 's cart , which was passing along the boulevard , shook the frail bed , like a clap of thunder , and made it quiver from top to bottom . 
`` Yes , madame ! '' 
cried Cosette , waking with a start , `` here I am ! 
here I am ! '' 
And she sprang out of bed , her eyes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep , extending her arms towards the corner of the wall . 
`` Ah ! 
mon Dieu , my broom ! '' 
said she . 
She opened her eyes wide now , and beheld the smiling countenance of Jean Valjean . 
`` Ah ! 
so it is true ! '' 
said the child . 
`` Good morning , Monsieur . '' 
Children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly , being themselves by nature joy and happiness . 
Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed , and took possession of her , and , as she played , she put a hundred questions to Jean Valjean . 
Where was she ? 
Was Paris very large ? 
Was Madame Thenardier very far away ? 
Was she to go back ? 
etc. , etc. . 
All at once she exclaimed , `` How pretty it is here ! '' 
It was a frightful hole , but she felt free . 
`` Must I sweep ? '' 
she resumed at last . 
`` Play ! '' 
said Jean Valjean . 
The day passed thus . 
Cosette , without troubling herself to understand anything , was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man . 
TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE On the following morning , at daybreak , Jean Valjean was still by Cosette 's bedside ; he watched there motionless , waiting for her to wake . 
Some new thing had come into his soul . 
Jean Valjean had never loved anything ; for twenty-five years he had been alone in the world . 
He had never been father , lover , husband , friend . 
In the prison he had been vicious , gloomy , chaste , ignorant , and shy . 
The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity . 
His sister and his sister 's children had left him only a vague and far-off memory which had finally almost completely vanished ; he had made every effort to find them , and not having been able to find them , he had forgotten them . 
Human nature is made thus ; the other tender emotions of his youth , if he had ever had any , had fallen into an abyss . 
When he saw Cosette , when he had taken possession of her , carried her off , and delivered her , he felt his heart moved within him . 
All the passion and affection within him awoke , and rushed towards that child . 
He approached the bed , where she lay sleeping , and trembled with joy . 
He suffered all the pangs of a mother , and he knew not what it meant ; for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing . 
Poor old man , with a perfectly new heart ! 
Only , as he was five and fifty , and Cosette eight years of age , all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light . 
It was the second white apparition which he had encountered . 
The Bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon ; Cosette caused the dawn of love to rise . 
The early days passed in this dazzled state . 
Cosette , on her side , had also , unknown to herself , become another being , poor little thing ! 
She was so little when her mother left her , that she no longer remembered her . 
Like all children , who resemble young shoots of the vine , which cling to everything , she had tried to love ; she had not succeeded . 
All had repulsed her , -- the Thenardiers , their children , other children . 
She had loved the dog , and he had died , after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her . 
It is a sad thing to say , and we have already intimated it , that , at eight years of age , her heart was cold . 
It was not her fault ; it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked ; alas ! 
it was the possibility . 
Thus , from the very first day , all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man . 
She felt that which she had never felt before -- a sensation of expansion . 
The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor ; she thought Jean Valjean handsome , just as she thought the hovel pretty . 
These are the effects of the dawn , of childhood , of joy . 
The novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here . 
Nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret . 
We all have in our past a delightful garret . 
Nature , a difference of fifty years , had set a profound gulf between Jean Valjean and Cosette ; destiny filled in this gulf . 
Destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences , differing in age , alike in sorrow . 
One , in fact , completed the other . 
Cosette 's instinct sought a father , as Jean Valjean 's instinct sought a child . 
To meet was to find each other . 
At the mysterious moment when their hands touched , they were welded together . 
When these two souls perceived each other , they recognized each other as necessary to each other , and embraced each other closely . 
Taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense , we may say that , separated from every one by the walls of the tomb , Jean Valjean was the widower , and Cosette was the orphan : this situation caused Jean Valjean to become Cosette 's father after a celestial fashion . 
And in truth , the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion , but a reality . 
The entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God . 
Moreover , Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well . 
There he seemed perfectly secure . 
The chamber with a dressing-room , which he occupied with Cosette , was the one whose window opened on the boulevard . 
This being the only window in the house , no neighbors ' glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side . 
The ground-floor of Number 50-52 , a sort of dilapidated penthouse , served as a wagon-house for market-gardeners , and no communication existed between it and the first story . 
It was separated by the flooring , which had neither traps nor stairs , and which formed the diaphragm of the building , as it were . 
The first story contained , as we have said , numerous chambers and several attics , only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean 's housekeeping ; all the rest was uninhabited . 
It was this old woman , ornamented with the name of the principal lodger , and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress , who had let him the lodging on Christmas eve . 
He had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds , who was coming there to live with his little daughter . 
He had paid her six months in advance , and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing-room , as we have seen . 
It was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove , and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival . 
Week followed week ; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel . 
Cosette laughed , chattered , and sang from daybreak . 
Children have their morning song as well as birds . 
It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand , all cracked with chilblains , and kissed it . 
The poor child , who was used to being beaten , did not know the meaning of this , and ran away in confusion . 
At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown . 
Cosette was no longer in rags ; she was in mourning . 
She had emerged from misery , and she was entering into life . 
Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read . 
Sometimes , as he made the child spell , he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison . 
This idea had ended in teaching a child to read . 
Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of the angels . 
He felt in it a premeditation from on high , the will of some one who was not man , and he became absorbed in revery . 
Good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones . 
To teach Cosette to read , and to let her play , this constituted nearly the whole of Jean Valjean 's existence . 
And then he talked of her mother , and he made her pray . 
She called him father , and knew no other name for him . 
He passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll , and in listening to her prattle . 
Life , henceforth , appeared to him to be full of interest ; men seemed to him good and just ; he no longer reproached any one in thought ; he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man , now that this child loved him . 
He saw a whole future stretching out before him , illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light . 
The best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts . 
At times , he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly . 
This is only a personal opinion ; but , to utter our whole thought , at the point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette , it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well-doing . 
He had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect -- incomplete aspects , which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth , the fate of woman as summed up in Fantine , and public authority as personified in Javert . 
He had returned to prison , this time for having done right ; he had quaffed fresh bitterness ; disgust and lassitude were overpowering him ; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse , though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant ; but , after all , that sacred memory was growing dim . 
Who knows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more ? 
He loved and grew strong again . 
Alas ! 
he walked with no less indecision than Cosette . 
He protected her , and she strengthened him . 
Thanks to him , she could walk through life ; thanks to her , he could continue in virtue . 
He was that child 's stay , and she was his prop . 
Oh , unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny ! 
THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT Jean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day . 
Every evening , at twilight , he walked for an hour or two , sometimes alone , often with Cosette , seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard , and entering churches at nightfall . 
He liked to go to Saint-Medard , which is the nearest church . 
When he did not take Cosette with him , she remained with the old woman ; but the child 's delight was to go out with the good man . 
She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete-a-tetes with Catherine . 
He held her hand as they walked , and said sweet things to her . 
It turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person . 
The old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market . 
They lived soberly , always having a little fire , but like people in very moderate circumstances . 
Jean Valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day ; he had merely had the glass door leading to Cosette 's dressing-room replaced by a solid door . 
He still wore his yellow coat , his black breeches , and his old hat . 
In the street , he was taken for a poor man . 
It sometimes happened that kind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him . 
Jean Valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow . 
It also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms ; then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him , stealthily approached the unfortunate man , put a piece of money into his hand , often a silver coin , and walked rapidly away . 
This had its disadvantages . 
He began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms . 
The old principal lodger , a cross-looking creature , who was thoroughly permeated , so far as her neighbors were concerned , with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons , scrutinized Jean Valjean a great deal , without his suspecting the fact . 
She was a little deaf , which rendered her talkative . 
There remained to her from her past , two teeth , -- one above , the other below , -- which she was continually knocking against each other . 
She had questioned Cosette , who had not been able to tell her anything , since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from Montfermeil . 
One morning , this spy saw Jean Valjean , with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar , entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel . 
She followed him with the step of an old cat , and was able to observe him without being seen , through a crack in the door , which was directly opposite him . 
Jean Valjean had his back turned towards this door , by way of greater security , no doubt . 
The old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case , scissors , and thread ; then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat , and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper , which he unfolded . 
The old woman recognized , with terror , the fact that it was a bank-bill for a thousand francs . 
It was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence . 
She fled in alarm . 
A moment later , Jean Valjean accosted her , and asked her to go and get this thousand-franc bill changed for him , adding that it was his quarterly income , which he had received the day before . 
`` Where ? '' 
thought the old woman . 
`` He did not go out until six o'clock in the evening , and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour . '' 
The old woman went to get the bill changed , and mentioned her surmises . 
That thousand-franc note , commented on and multiplied , produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the Rue des Vignes Saint-Marcel . 
A few days later , it chanced that Jean Valjean was sawing some wood , in his shirt-sleeves , in the corridor . 
The old woman was in the chamber , putting things in order . 
She was alone . 
Cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed . 
The old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on a nail , and examined it . 
The lining had been sewed up again . 
The good woman felt of it carefully , and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thicknesses of paper . 
More thousand-franc bank-bills , no doubt ! 
She also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets . 
Not only the needles , thread , and scissors which she had seen , but a big pocket-book , a very large knife , and -- a suspicious circumstance -- several wigs of various colors . 
Each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents . 
Thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter . 
A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULT Near Saint-Medard 's church there was a poor man who was in the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned , and on whom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity . 
He never passed this man without giving him a few sous . 
Sometimes he spoke to him . 
Those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police . 
He was an ex-beadle of seventy-five , who was constantly mumbling his prayers . 
One evening , as Jean Valjean was passing by , when he had not Cosette with him , he saw the beggar in his usual place , beneath the lantern which had just been lighted . 
The man seemed engaged in prayer , according to his custom , and was much bent over . 
Jean Valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand . 
The mendicant raised his eyes suddenly , stared intently at Jean Valjean , then dropped his head quickly . 
This movement was like a flash of lightning . 
Jean Valjean was seized with a shudder . 
It seemed to him that he had just caught sight , by the light of the street lantern , not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle , but of a well-known and startling face . 
He experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one 's self , all of a sudden , face to face , in the dark , with a tiger . 
He recoiled , terrified , petrified , daring neither to breathe , to speak , to remain , nor to flee , staring at the beggar who had dropped his head , which was enveloped in a rag , and no longer appeared to know that he was there . 
At this strange moment , an instinct -- possibly the mysterious instinct of self-preservation , -- restrained Jean Valjean from uttering a word . 
The beggar had the same figure , the same rags , the same appearance as he had every day . 
`` Bah ! '' 
said Jean Valjean , `` I am mad ! 
I am dreaming ! 
Impossible ! '' 
And he returned profoundly troubled . 
He hardly dared to confess , even to himself , that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of Javert . 
That night , on thinking the matter over , he regretted not having questioned the man , in order to force him to raise his head a second time . 
On the following day , at nightfall , he went back . 
The beggar was at his post . 
`` Good day , my good man , '' said Jean Valjean , resolutely , handing him a sou . 
The beggar raised his head , and replied in a whining voice , `` Thanks , my good sir . '' 
It was unmistakably the ex-beadle . 
Jean Valjean felt completely reassured . 
He began to laugh . 
`` How the deuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there ? '' 
he thought . 
`` Am I going to lose my eyesight now ? '' 
And he thought no more about it . 
A few days afterwards , -- it might have been at eight o'clock in the evening , -- he was in his room , and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud , when he heard the house door open and then shut again . 
This struck him as singular . 
The old woman , who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself , always went to bed at nightfall , so that she might not burn out her candles . 
Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet . 
He heard some one ascending the stairs . 
It might possibly be the old woman , who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary 's . 
Jean Valjean listened . 
The step was heavy , and sounded like that of a man ; but the old woman wore stout shoes , and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman . 
Nevertheless , Jean Valjean blew out his candle . 
He had sent Cosette to bed , saying to her in a low voice , `` Get into bed very softly '' ; and as he kissed her brow , the steps paused .
