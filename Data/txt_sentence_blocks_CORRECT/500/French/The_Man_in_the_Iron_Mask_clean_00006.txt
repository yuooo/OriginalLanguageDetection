`` Not I , certainly , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` but I believe it was M. Colbert . '' 
Colbert , having heard his name pronounced , said , `` What was M. d'Artagnan good enough to say ? '' 
`` I was good enough to remark that it was you who stopped the king 's progress , so that he might taste the vin de Brie . 
Was I right ? '' 
`` Quite so , monsieur . '' 
`` In that case , then , it was you whom the king called some name or other . '' 
`` What name ? '' 
`` I hardly know ; but wait a moment - idiot , I think it was - no , no , it was fool or dolt . 
Yes ; his majesty said that the man who had thought of the vin de Melun was something of the sort . '' 
D'Artagnan , after this broadside , quietly caressed his mustache ; M. Colbert 's large head seemed to become larger and larger than ever . 
D'Artagnan , seeing how ugly anger made him , did not stop half-way . 
The orator still went on with his speech , while the king 's color was visibly increasing . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said the musketeer , coolly , `` the king is going to have an attack of determination of blood to the head . 
Where the deuce did you get hold of that idea , Monsieur Colbert ? 
You have no luck . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said the financier , drawing himself up , `` my zeal for the king 's service inspired me with the idea . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
`` Monsieur , Melun is a city , an excellent city , which pays well , and which it would be imprudent to displease . '' 
`` There , now ! 
I , who do not pretend to be a financier , saw only one idea in your idea . '' 
`` What was that , monsieur ? '' 
`` That of causing a little annoyance to M. Fouquet , who is making himself quite giddy on his donjons yonder , in waiting for us . '' 
This was a home-stroke , hard enough in all conscience . 
Colbert was completely thrown out of the saddle by it , and retired , thoroughly discomfited . 
Fortunately , the speech was now at an end ; the king drank the wine which was presented to him , and then every one resumed the progress through the city . 
The king bit his lips in anger , for the evening was closing in , and all hope of a walk with La Valliere was at an end . 
In order that the whole of the king 's household should enter Vaux , four hours at least were necessary , owing to the different arrangements . 
The king , therefore , who was boiling with impatience , hurried forward as much as possible , in order to reach it before nightfall . 
But , at the moment he was setting off again , other and fresh difficulties arose . 
`` Is not the king going to sleep at Melun ? '' 
said Colbert , in a low tone of voice , to D'Artagnan . 
M. Colbert must have been badly inspired that day , to address himself in that manner to the chief of the musketeers ; for the latter guessed that the king 's intention was very far from that of remaining where he was . 
D'Artagnan would not allow him to enter Vaux except he were well and strongly accompanied ; and desired that his majesty would not enter except with all the escort . 
On the other hand , he felt that these delays would irritate that impatient monarch beyond measure . 
In what way could he possibly reconcile these difficulties ? 
D'Artagnan took up Colbert 's remark , and determined to repeated it to the king . 
`` Sire , '' he said , `` M. Colbert has been asking me if your majesty does not intend to sleep at Melun . '' 
`` Sleep at Melun ! 
What for ? '' 
exclaimed Louis XIV . 
`` Sleep at Melun ! 
Who , in Heaven 's name , can have thought of such a thing , when M. Fouquet is expecting us this evening ? '' 
`` It was simply , '' replied Colbert , quickly , `` the fear of causing your majesty the least delay ; for , according to established etiquette , you can not enter any place , with the exception of your own royal residences , until the soldiers ' quarters have been marked out by the quartermaster , and the garrison properly distributed . '' 
D'Artagnan listened with the greatest attention , biting his mustache to conceal his vexation ; and the queens were not less interested . 
They were fatigued , and would have preferred to go to rest without proceeding any farther ; more especially , in order to prevent the king walking about in the evening with M. de Saint-Aignan and the ladies of the court , for , if etiquette required the princesses to remain within their own rooms , the ladies of honor , as soon as they had performed the services required of them , had no restrictions placed upon them , but were at liberty to walk about as they pleased . 
It will easily be conjectured that all these rival interests , gathering together in vapors , necessarily produced clouds , and that the clouds were likely to be followed by a tempest . 
The king had no mustache to gnaw , and therefore kept biting the handle of his whip instead , with ill-concealed impatience . 
How could he get out of it ? 
D'Artagnan looked as agreeable as possible , and Colbert as sulky as he could . 
Who was there he could get in a passion with ? 
`` We will consult the queen , '' said Louis XIV. , bowing to the royal ladies . 
And this kindness of consideration softened Maria Theresa 's heart , who , being of a kind and generous disposition , when left to her own free-will , replied : `` I shall be delighted to do whatever your majesty wishes . '' 
`` How long will it take us to get to Vaux ? '' 
inquired Anne of Austria , in slow and measured accents , placing her hand upon her bosom , where the seat of her pain lay . 
`` An hour for your majesty 's carriages , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` the roads are tolerably good . '' 
The king looked at him . 
`` And a quarter of an hour for the king , '' he hastened to add . 
`` We should arrive by daylight ? '' 
said Louis XIV . 
`` But the billeting of the king 's military escort , '' objected Colbert , softly , `` will make his majesty lose all the advantage of his speed , however quick he may be . '' 
`` Double ass that you are ! '' 
thought D'Artagnan ; `` if I had any interest or motive in demolishing your credit with the king , I could do it in ten minutes . 
If I were in the king 's place , '' he added aloud , `` I should , in going to M. Fouquet , leave my escort behind me ; I should go to him as a friend ; I should enter accompanied only by my captain of the guards ; I should consider that I was acting more nobly , and should be invested with a still more sacred character by doing so . '' 
Delight sparkled in the king 's eyes . 
`` That is indeed a very sensible suggestion . 
We will go to see a friend as friends ; the gentlemen who are with the carriages can go slowly : but we who are mounted will ride on . '' 
And he rode off , accompanied by all those who were mounted . 
Colbert hid his ugly head behind his horse 's neck . 
`` I shall be quits , '' said D'Artagnan , as he galloped along , `` by getting a little talk with Aramis this evening . 
And then , M. Fouquet is a man of honor . 
Mordioux ! 
I have said so , and it must be so . '' 
And this was the way how , towards seven o'clock in the evening , without announcing his arrival by the din of trumpets , and without even his advanced guard , without out-riders or musketeers , the king presented himself before the gate of Vaux , where Fouquet , who had been informed of his royal guest 's approach , had been waiting for the last half-hour , with his head uncovered , surrounded by his household and his friends . 
: Nectar and Ambrosia . 
M. Fouquet held the stirrup of the king , who , having dismounted , bowed most graciously , and more graciously still held out his hand to him , which Fouquet , in spite of a slight resistance on the king 's part , carried respectfully to his lips . 
The king wished to wait in the first courtyard for the arrival of the carriages , nor had he long to wait , for the roads had been put into excellent order by the superintendent , and a stone would hardly have been found of the size of an egg the whole way from Melun to Vaux ; so that the carriages , rolling along as though on a carpet , brought the ladies to Vaux , without jolting or fatigue , by eight o'clock . 
They were received by Madame Fouquet , and at the moment they made their appearance , a light as bright as day burst forth from every quarter , trees , vases , and marble statues . 
This species of enchantment lasted until their majesties had retired into the palace . 
All these wonders and magical effects which the chronicler has heaped up , or rather embalmed , in his recital , at the risk of rivaling the brain-born scenes of romancers ; these splendors whereby night seemed vanquished and nature corrected , together with every delight and luxury combined for the satisfaction of all the senses , as well as the imagination , Fouquet did in real truth offer to his sovereign in that enchanting retreat of which no monarch could at that time boast of possessing an equal . 
We do not intend to describe the grand banquet , at which the royal guests were present , nor the concerts , nor the fairy-like and more than magic transformations and metamorphoses ; it will be enough for our purpose to depict the countenance the king assumed , which , from being gay , soon wore a very gloomy , constrained , and irritated expression . 
He remembered his own residence , royal though it was , and the mean and indifferent style of luxury that prevailed there , which comprised but little more than what was merely useful for the royal wants , without being his own personal property . 
The large vases of the Louvre , the older furniture and plate of Henry II. , of Francis I. , and of Louis XI. , were but historic monuments of earlier days ; nothing but specimens of art , the relics of his predecessors ; while with Fouquet , the value of the article was as much in the workmanship as in the article itself . 
Fouquet ate from a gold service , which artists in his own employ had modeled and cast for him alone . 
Fouquet drank wines of which the king of France did not even know the name , and drank them out of goblets each more valuable than the entire royal cellar . 
What , too , was to be said of the apartments , the hangings , the pictures , the servants and officers , of every description , of his household ? 
What of the mode of service in which etiquette was replaced by order ; stiff formality by personal , unrestrained comfort ; the happiness and contentment of the guest became the supreme law of all who obeyed the host ? 
The perfect swarm of busily engaged persons moving about noiselessly ; the multitude of guests , - who were , however , even less numerous than the servants who waited on them , - the myriad of exquisitely prepared dishes , of gold and silver vases ; the floods of dazzling light , the masses of unknown flowers of which the hot-houses had been despoiled , redundant with luxuriance of unequaled scent and beauty ; the perfect harmony of the surroundings , which , indeed , was no more than the prelude of the promised fete , charmed all who were there ; and they testified their admiration over and over again , not by voice or gesture , but by deep silence and rapt attention , those two languages of the courtier which acknowledge the hand of no master powerful enough to restrain them . 
As for the king , his eyes filled with tears ; he dared not look at the queen . 
Anne of Austria , whose pride was superior to that of any creature breathing , overwhelmed her host by the contempt with which she treated everything handed to her . 
The young queen , kind-hearted by nature and curious by disposition , praised Fouquet , ate with an exceedingly good appetite , and asked the names of the strange fruits as they were placed upon the table . 
Fouquet replied that he was not aware of their names . 
The fruits came from his own stores ; he had often cultivated them himself , having an intimate acquaintance with the cultivation of exotic fruits and plants . 
The king felt and appreciated the delicacy of the replies , but was only the more humiliated ; he thought the queen a little too familiar in her manners , and that Anne of Austria resembled Juno a little too much , in being too proud and haughty ; his chief anxiety , however , was himself , that he might remain cold and distant in his behavior , bordering lightly the limits of supreme disdain or simple admiration . 
But Fouquet had foreseen all this ; he was , in fact , one of those men who foresee everything . 
The king had expressly declared that , so long as he remained under Fouquet 's roof , he did not wish his own different repasts to be served in accordance with the usual etiquette , and that he would , consequently , dine with the rest of society ; but by the thoughtful attention of the surintendant , the king 's dinner was served up separately , if one may so express it , in the middle of the general table ; the dinner , wonderful in every respect , from the dishes of which was composed , comprised everything the king liked and generally preferred to anything else . 
Louis had no excuse - he , indeed , who had the keenest appetite in his kingdom - for saying that he was not hungry . 
Nay , M. Fouquet did even better still ; he certainly , in obedience to the king 's expressed desire , seated himself at the table , but as soon as the soups were served , he arose and personally waited on the king , while Madame Fouquet stood behind the queen-mother 's armchair . 
The disdain of Juno and the sulky fits of temper of Jupiter could not resist this excess of kindly feeling and polite attention . 
The queen ate a biscuit dipped in a glass of San-Lucar wine ; and the king ate of everything , saying to M. Fouquet : `` It is impossible , monsieur le surintendant , to dine better anywhere . '' 
Whereupon the whole court began , on all sides , to devour the dishes spread before them with such enthusiasm that it looked as though a cloud of Egyptian locusts was settling down on green and growing crops . 
As soon , however , as his hunger was appeased , the king became morose and overgloomed again ; the more so in proportion to the satisfaction he fancied he had previously manifested , and particularly on account of the deferential manner which his courtiers had shown towards Fouquet . 
D'Artagnan , who ate a good deal and drank but little , without allowing it to be noticed , did not lose a single opportunity , but made a great number of observations which he turned to good profit . 
When the supper was finished , the king expressed a wish not to lose the promenade . 
The park was illuminated ; the moon , too , as if she had placed herself at the orders of the lord of Vaux , silvered the trees and lake with her own bright and quasi-phosphorescent light . 
The air was strangely soft and balmy ; the daintily shell-gravelled walks through the thickly set avenues yielded luxuriously to the feet . 
The fete was complete in every respect , for the king , having met La Valliere in one of the winding paths of the wood , was able to press her hand and say , `` I love you , '' without any one overhearing him except M. d'Artagnan , who followed , and M. Fouquet , who preceded him . 
The dreamy night of magical enchantments stole smoothly on . 
The king having requested to be shown to his room , there was immediately a movement in every direction . 
The queens passed to their own apartments , accompanied by them music of theorbos and lutes ; the king found his musketeers awaiting him on the grand flight of steps , for M. Fouquet had brought them on from Melun and had invited them to supper . 
D'Artagnan 's suspicions at once disappeared . 
He was weary , he had supped well , and wished , for once in his life , thoroughly to enjoy a fete given by a man who was in every sense of the word a king . 
`` M. Fouquet , '' he said , `` is the man for me . '' 
The king was conducted with the greatest ceremony to the chamber of Morpheus , of which we owe some cursory description to our readers . 
It was the handsomest and largest in the palace . 
Lebrun had painted on the vaulted ceiling the happy as well as the unhappy dreams which Morpheus inflicts on kings as well as on other men . 
Everything that sleep gives birth to that is lovely , its fairy scenes , its flowers and nectar , the wild voluptuousness or profound repose of the senses , had the painter elaborated on his frescoes . 
It was a composition as soft and pleasing in one part as dark and gloomy and terrible in another . 
The poisoned chalice , the glittering dagger suspended over the head of the sleeper ; wizards and phantoms with terrific masks , those half-dim shadows more alarming than the approach of fire or the somber face of midnight , these , and such as these , he had made the companions of his more pleasing pictures . 
No sooner had the king entered his room than a cold shiver seemed to pass through him , and on Fouquet asking him the cause of it , the king replied , as pale as death : `` I am sleepy , that is all . '' 
`` Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once ? '' 
`` No ; I have to talk with a few persons first , '' said the king . 
`` Will you have the goodness to tell M. Colbert I wish to see him . '' 
Fouquet bowed and left the room . 
: A Gascon , and a Gascon and a Half . 
D'Artagnan had determined to lose no time , and in fact he never was in the habit of doing so . 
After having inquired for Aramis , he had looked for him in every direction until he had succeeded in finding him . 
Besides , no sooner had the king entered Vaux , than Aramis had retired to his own room , meditating , doubtless , some new piece of gallant attention for his majesty 's amusement . 
D'Artagnan desired the servants to announce him , and found on the second story -LRB- in a beautiful room called the Blue Chamber , on account of the color of its hangings -RRB- the bishop of Vannes in company with Porthos and several of the modern Epicureans . 
Aramis came forward to embrace his friend , and offered him the best seat . 
As it was after awhile generally remarked among those present that the musketeer was reserved , and wished for an opportunity for conversing secretly with Aramis , the Epicureans took their leave . 
Porthos , however , did not stir ; for true it is that , having dined exceedingly well , he was fast asleep in his armchair ; and the freedom of conversation therefore was not interrupted by a third person . 
Porthos had a deep , harmonious snore , and people might talk in the midst of its loud bass without fear of disturbing him . 
D'Artagnan felt that he was called upon to open the conversation . 
`` Well , and so we have come to Vaux , '' he said . 
`` Why , yes , D'Artagnan . 
And how do you like the place ? '' 
`` Very much , and I like M. Fouquet , also . '' 
`` Is he not a charming host ? '' 
`` No one could be more so . '' 
`` I am told that the king began by showing great distance of manner towards M. Fouquet , but that his majesty grew much more cordial afterwards . '' 
`` You did not notice it , then , since you say you have been told so ? '' 
`` No ; I was engaged with the gentlemen who have just left the room about the theatrical performances and the tournaments which are to take place to-morrow . '' 
`` Ah , indeed ! 
you are the comptroller-general of the fetes here , then ? '' 
`` You know I am a friend of all kinds of amusement where the exercise of the imagination is called into activity ; I have always been a poet in one way or another . '' 
`` Yes , I remember the verses you used to write , they were charming . '' 
`` I have forgotten them , but I am delighted to read the verses of others , when those others are known by the names of Moliere , Pelisson , La Fontaine , etc. '' `` Do you know what idea occurred to me this evening , Aramis ? '' 
`` No ; tell me what it was , for I should never be able to guess it , you have so many . '' 
`` Well , the idea occurred to me , that the true king of France is not Louis XIV . '' 
`` What ! '' 
said Aramis , involuntarily , looking the musketeer full in the eyes . 
`` No , it is Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
Aramis breathed again , and smiled . 
`` Ah ! 
you are like all the rest , jealous , '' he said . 
`` I would wager that it was M. Colbert who turned that pretty phrase . '' 
D'Artagnan , in order to throw Aramis off his guard , related Colbert 's misadventures with regard to the vin de Melun . 
`` He comes of a mean race , does Colbert , '' said Aramis . 
`` Quite true . '' 
`` When I think , too , '' added the bishop , `` that that fellow will be your minister within four months , and that you will serve him as blindly as you did Richelieu or Mazarin - '' `` And as you serve M. Fouquet , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` With this difference , though , that M. Fouquet is not M. Colbert . '' 
`` True , true , '' said D'Artagnan , as he pretended to become sad and full of reflection ; and then , a moment after , he added , `` Why do you tell me that M. Colbert will be minister in four months ? '' 
`` Because M. Fouquet will have ceased to be so , '' replied Aramis . 
`` He will be ruined , you mean ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Completely so . '' 
`` Why does he give these fetes , then ? '' 
said the musketeer , in a tone so full of thoughtful consideration , and so well assumed , that the bishop was for the moment deceived by it . 
`` Why did you not dissuade him from it ? '' 
The latter part of the phrase was just a little too much , and Aramis 's former suspicions were again aroused . 
`` It is done with the object of humoring the king . '' 
`` By ruining himself ? '' 
`` Yes , by ruining himself for the king . '' 
`` A most eccentric , one might say , sinister calculation , that . '' 
`` Necessity , necessity , my friend . '' 
`` I do n't see that , dear Aramis . '' 
`` Do you not ? 
Have you not remarked M. Colbert 's daily increasing antagonism , and that he is doing his utmost to drive the king to get rid of the superintendent ? '' 
`` One must be blind not to see it . '' 
`` And that a cabal is already armed against M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` That is well known . '' 
`` What likelihood is there that the king would join a party formed against a man who will have spent everything he had to please him ? '' 
`` True , true , '' said D'Artagnan , slowly , hardly convinced , yet curious to broach another phase of the conversation . 
`` There are follies , and follies , '' he resumed , `` and I do not like those you are committing . '' 
`` What do you allude to ? '' 
`` As for the banquet , the ball , the concert , the theatricals , the tournaments , the cascades , the fireworks , the illuminations , and the presents - these are well and good , I grant ; but why were not these expenses sufficient ? 
Why was it necessary to have new liveries and costumes for your whole household ? '' 
`` You are quite right . 
I told M. Fouquet that myself ; he replied , that if he were rich enough he would offer the king a newly erected chateau , from the vanes at the houses to the very sub-cellars ; completely new inside and out ; and that , as soon as the king had left , he would burn the whole building and its contents , in order that it might not be made use of by any one else . '' 
`` How completely Spanish ! '' 
`` I told him so , and he then added this : ` Whoever advises me to spare expense , I shall look upon as my enemy . ' '' 
`` It is positive madness ; and that portrait , too ! '' 
`` What portrait ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` That of the king , and the surprise as well . '' 
`` What surprise ? '' 
`` The surprise you seem to have in view , and on account of which you took some specimens away , when I met you at Percerin 's . '' 
D'Artagnan paused . 
The shaft was discharged , and all he had to do was to wait and watch its effect . 
`` That is merely an act of graceful attention , '' replied Aramis . 
D'Artagnan went up to his friend , took hold of both his hands , and looking him full in the eyes , said , `` Aramis , do you still care for me a very little ? '' 
`` What a question to ask ! '' 
`` Very good . 
One favor , then . 
Why did you take some patterns of the king 's costumes at Percerin 's ? '' 
`` Come with me and ask poor Lebrun , who has been working upon them for the last two days and nights . '' 
`` Aramis , that may be truth for everybody else , but for me - '' `` Upon my word , D'Artagnan , you astonish me . '' 
`` Be a little considerate . 
Tell me the exact truth ; you would not like anything disagreeable to happen to me , would you ? '' 
`` My dear friend , you are becoming quite incomprehensible . 
What suspicion can you have possibly got hold of ? '' 
`` Do you believe in my instinctive feelings ? 
Formerly you used to have faith in them . 
Well , then , an instinct tells me that you have some concealed project on foot . '' 
`` I - a project ? '' 
`` I am convinced of it . '' 
`` What nonsense ! '' 
`` I am not only sure of it , but I would even swear it . '' 
`` Indeed , D'Artagnan , you cause me the greatest pain . 
Is it likely , if I have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you , I should tell you about it ? 
If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed , should I not have long ago divulged it ? '' 
`` No , Aramis , no . 
There are certain projects which are never revealed until the favorable opportunity arrives . '' 
`` In that case , my dear fellow , '' returned the bishop , laughing , `` the only thing now is , that the ` opportunity ' has not yet arrived . '' 
D'Artagnan shook his head with a sorrowful expression . 
`` Oh , friendship , friendship ! '' 
he said , `` what an idle word you are ! 
Here is a man who , if I were but to ask it , would suffer himself to be cut in pieces for my sake . '' 
`` You are right , '' said Aramis , nobly . 
`` And this man , who would shed every drop of blood in his veins for me , will not open up before me the least corner in his heart . 
Friendship , I repeat , is nothing but an unsubstantial shadow - a lure , like everything else in this bright , dazzling world . '' 
`` It is not thus you should speak of our friendship , '' replied the bishop , in a firm , assured voice ; `` for ours is not of the same nature as those of which you have been speaking . '' 
`` Look at us , Aramis ; three out of the old ` four . ' 
You are deceiving me ; I suspect you ; and Porthos is fast asleep . 
An admirable trio of friends , do n't you think so ? 
What an affecting relic of the former dear old times ! '' 
`` I can only tell you one thing , D'Artagnan , and I swear it on the Bible : I love you just as I used to do . 
If I ever suspect you , it is on account of others , and not on account of either of us . 
In everything I may do , and should happen to succeed in , you will find your fourth . 
Will you promise me the same favor ? '' 
`` If I am not mistaken , Aramis , your words - at the moment you pronounce them - are full of generous feeling . '' 
`` Such a thing is very possible . '' 
`` You are conspiring against M. Colbert . 
If that be all , mordioux , tell me so at once . 
I have the instrument in my own hand , and will pull out the tooth easily enough . '' 
Aramis could not conceal a smile of disdain that flitted over his haughty features . 
`` And supposing that I were conspiring against Colbert , what harm would there be in that ? '' 
`` No , no ; that would be too trifling a matter for you to take in hand , and it was not on that account you asked Percerin for those patterns of the king 's costumes . 
Oh ! 
Aramis , we are not enemies , remember - we are brothers . 
Tell me what you wish to undertake , and , upon the word of a D'Artagnan , if I can not help you , I will swear to remain neuter . '' 
`` I am undertaking nothing , '' said Aramis . 
`` Aramis , a voice within me speaks and seems to trickle forth a rill of light within my darkness : it is a voice that has never yet deceived me . 
It is the king you are conspiring against . '' 
`` The king ? '' 
exclaimed the bishop , pretending to be annoyed . 
`` Your face will not convince me ; the king , I repeat . '' 
`` Will you help me ? '' 
said Aramis , smiling ironically . 
`` Aramis , I will do more than help you - I will do more than remain neuter - I will save you . '' 
`` You are mad , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` I am the wiser of the two , in this matter . '' 
`` You to suspect me of wishing to assassinate the king ! '' 
`` Who spoke of such a thing ? '' 
smiled the musketeer . 
`` Well , let us understand one another . 
I do not see what any one can do to a legitimate king as ours is , if he does not assassinate him . '' 
D'Artagnan did not say a word . 
`` Besides , you have your guards and your musketeers here , '' said the bishop . 
`` True . '' 
`` You are not in M. Fouquet 's house , but in your own . '' 
`` True ; but in spite of that , Aramis , grant me , for pity 's sake , one single word of a true friend . '' 
`` A true friend 's word is ever truth itself . 
If I think of touching , even with my finger , the son of Anne of Austria , the true king of this realm of France - if I have not the firm intention of prostrating myself before his throne - if in every idea I may entertain to-morrow , here at Vaux , will not be the most glorious day my king ever enjoyed - may Heaven 's lightning blast me where I stand ! '' 
Aramis had pronounced these words with his face turned towards the alcove of his own bedroom , where D'Artagnan , seated with his back towards the alcove , could not suspect that any one was lying concealed . 
The earnestness of his words , the studied slowness with which he pronounced them , the solemnity of his oath , gave the musketeer the most complete satisfaction . 
He took hold of both Aramis 's hands , and shook them cordially . 
Aramis had endured reproaches without turning pale , and had blushed as he listened to words of praise . 
D'Artagnan , deceived , did him honor ; but D'Artagnan , trustful and reliant , made him feel ashamed . 
`` Are you going away ? '' 
he said , as he embraced him , in order to conceal the flush on his face . 
`` Yes . 
Duty summons me . 
I have to get the watch-word . 
It seems I am to be lodged in the king 's ante-room . 
Where does Porthos sleep ? '' 
`` Take him away with you , if you like , for he rumbles through his sleepy nose like a park of artillery . '' 
`` Ah ! 
he does not stay with you , then ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Not the least in the world . 
He has a chamber to himself , but I do n't know where . '' 
`` Very good ! '' 
said the musketeer ; from whom this separation of the two associates removed his last suspicion , and he touched Porthos lightly on the shoulder ; the latter replied by a loud yawn . 
`` Come , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` What , D'Artagnan , my dear fellow , is that you ? 
What a lucky chance ! 
Oh , yes - true ; I have forgotten ; I am at the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` Yes ; and your beautiful dress , too . '' 
`` Yes , it was very attentive on the part of Monsieur Coquelin de Voliere , was it not ? '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` You are walking so heavily you will make the flooring give way . '' 
`` True , '' said the musketeer ; `` this room is above the dome , I think . '' 
`` And I did not choose it for a fencing-room , I assure you , '' added the bishop . 
`` The ceiling of the king 's room has all the lightness and calm of wholesome sleep . 
Do not forget , therefore , that my flooring is merely the covering of his ceiling . 
Good night , my friends , and in ten minutes I shall be asleep myself . '' 
And Aramis accompanied them to the door , laughing quietly all the while . 
As soon as they were outside , he bolted the door , hurriedly ; closed up the chinks of the windows , and then called out , `` Monseigneur ! 
- monseigneur ! '' 
Philippe made his appearance from the alcove , as he pushed aside a sliding panel placed behind the bed . 
`` M. d'Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions , it seems , '' he said . 
`` Ah ! 
- you recognized M. d'Artagnan , then ? '' 
`` Before you called him by his name , even . '' 
`` He is your captain of musketeers . '' 
`` He is very devoted to me , '' replied Philippe , laying a stress upon the personal pronoun . 
`` As faithful as a dog ; but he bites sometimes . 
If D'Artagnan does not recognize you before the other has disappeared , rely upon D'Artagnan to the end of the world ; for in that case , if he has seen nothing , he will keep his fidelity . 
If he sees , when it is too late , he is a Gascon , and will never admit that he has been deceived . '' 
`` I thought so . 
What are we to do , now ? '' 
`` Sit in this folding-chair . 
I am going to push aside a portion of the flooring ; you will look through the opening , which answers to one of the false windows made in the dome of the king 's apartment . 
Can you see ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Philippe , starting as at the sight of an enemy ; `` I see the king ! '' 
`` What is he doing ? '' 
`` He seems to wish some man to sit down close to him . '' 
`` M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` No , no ; wait a moment - '' `` Look at the notes and the portraits , my prince . '' 
`` The man whom the king wishes to sit down in his presence is M. Colbert . '' 
`` Colbert sit down in the king 's presence ! '' 
exclaimed Aramis . 
`` It is impossible . '' 
`` Look . '' 
Aramis looked through the opening in the flooring . 
`` Yes , '' he said . 
`` Colbert himself . 
Oh , monseigneur ! 
what can we be going to hear - and what can result from this intimacy ? '' 
`` Nothing good for M. Fouquet , at all events . '' 
The prince did not deceive himself . 
We have seen that Louis XIV . 
had sent for Colbert , and Colbert had arrived . 
The conversation began between them by the king according to him one of the highest favors that he had ever done ; it was true the king was alone with his subject . 
`` Colbert , '' said he , `` sit down . '' 
The intendant , overcome with delight , for he feared he was about to be dismissed , refused this unprecedented honor . 
`` Does he accept ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` No , he remains standing . '' 
`` Let us listen , then . '' 
And the future king and the future pope listened eagerly to the simple mortals they held under their feet , ready to crush them when they liked . 
`` Colbert , '' said the king , `` you have annoyed me exceedingly to-day . '' 
`` I know it , sire . '' 
`` Very good ; I like that answer . 
Yes , you knew it , and there was courage in the doing of it . '' 
`` I ran the risk of displeasing your majesty , but I risked , also , the concealment of your best interests . '' 
`` What ! 
you were afraid of something on my account ? '' 
`` I was , sire , even if it were nothing more than an indigestion , '' said Colbert ; `` for people do not give their sovereigns such banquets as the one of to-day , unless it be to stifle them beneath the burden of good living . '' 
Colbert awaited the effect this coarse jest would produce upon the king ; and Louis XIV. , who was the vainest and the most fastidiously delicate man in his kingdom , forgave Colbert the joke . 
`` The truth is , '' he said , `` that M. Fouquet has given me too good a meal . 
Tell me , Colbert , where does he get all the money required for this enormous expenditure , - can you tell ? '' 
`` Yes , I do know , sire . '' 
`` Will you be able to prove it with tolerable certainty ? '' 
`` Easily ; and to the utmost farthing . '' 
`` I know you are very exact . '' 
`` Exactitude is the principal qualification required in an intendant of finances . '' 
`` But all are not so . '' 
`` I thank you majesty for so flattering a compliment from your own lips . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , therefore , is rich - very rich , and I suppose every man knows he is so . '' 
`` Every one , sire ; the living as well as the dead . '' 
`` What does that mean , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
`` The living are witnesses of M. Fouquet 's wealth , - they admire and applaud the result produced ; but the dead , wiser and better informed than we are , know how that wealth was obtained - and they rise up in accusation . '' 
`` So that M. Fouquet owes his wealth to some cause or other . '' 
`` The occupation of an intendant very often favors those who practice it . '' 
`` You have something to say to me more confidentially , I perceive ; do not be afraid , we are quite alone . '' 
`` I am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience , and under the protection of your majesty , '' said Colbert , bowing . 
`` If the dead , therefore , were to speak - '' `` They do speak sometimes , sire , - read . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
murmured Aramis , in the prince 's ear , who , close beside him , listened without losing a syllable , `` since you are placed here , monseigneur , in order to learn your vocation of a king , listen to a piece of infamy - of a nature truly royal . 
You are about to be a witness of one of those scenes which the foul fiend alone conceives and executes . 
Listen attentively , - you will find your advantage in it . '' 
The prince redoubled his attention , and saw Louis XIV . 
take from Colbert 's hands a letter the latter held out to him . 
`` The late cardinal 's handwriting , '' said the king . 
`` Your majesty has an excellent memory , '' replied Colbert , bowing ; `` it is an immense advantage for a king who is destined for hard work to recognize handwritings at the first glance . '' 
The king read Mazarin 's letter , and , as its contents are already known to the reader , in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de Chevreuse and Aramis , nothing further would be learned if we stated them here again . 
`` I do not quite understand , '' said the king , greatly interested . 
`` Your majesty has not acquired the utilitarian habit of checking the public accounts . '' 
`` I see that it refers to money that had been given to M. Fouquet . '' 
`` Thirteen millions . 
A tolerably good sum . '' 
`` Yes . 
Well , these thirteen millions are wanting to balance the total of the account . 
That is what I do not very well understand . 
How was this deficit possible ? '' 
`` Possible I do not say ; but there is no doubt about fact that it is really so . '' 
`` You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts ? '' 
`` I do not say so , but the registry does . '' 
`` And this letter of M. Mazarin indicates the employment of that sum and the name of the person with whom it was deposited ? '' 
`` As your majesty can judge for yourself . '' 
`` Yes ; and the result is , then , that M. Fouquet has not yet restored the thirteen millions . '' 
`` That results from the accounts , certainly , sire . '' 
`` Well , and , consequently - '' `` Well , sire , in that case , inasmuch as M. Fouquet has not yet given back the thirteen millions , he must have appropriated them to his own purpose ; and with those thirteen millions one could incur four times and a little more as much expense , and make four times as great a display , as your majesty was able to do at Fontainebleau , where we only spent three millions altogether , if you remember . '' 
For a blunderer , the souvenir he had evoked was a rather skillfully contrived piece of baseness ; for by the remembrance of his own fete he , for the first time , perceived its inferiority compared with that of Fouquet . 
Colbert received back again at Vaux what Fouquet had given him at Fontainebleau , and , as a good financier , returned it with the best possible interest . 
Having once disposed the king 's mind in this artful way , Colbert had nothing of much importance to detain him . 
He felt that such was the case , for the king , too , had again sunk into a dull and gloomy state . 
Colbert awaited the first words from the king 's lips with as much impatience as Philippe and Aramis did from their place of observation . 
`` Are you aware what is the usual and natural consequence of all this , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
said the king , after a few moments ' reflection . 
`` No , sire , I do not know . '' 
`` Well , then , the fact of the appropriation of the thirteen millions , if it can be proved - '' `` But it is so already . '' 
`` I mean if it were to be declared and certified , M. Colbert . '' 
`` I think it will be to-morrow , if your majesty - '' `` Were we not under M. Fouquet 's roof , you were going to say , perhaps , '' replied the king , with something of nobility in his demeanor . 
`` The king is in his own palace wherever he may be - especially in houses which the royal money has constructed . '' 
`` I think , '' said Philippe in a low tone to Aramis , `` that the architect who planned this dome ought , anticipating the use it could be put to at a future opportunity , so to have contrived that it might be made to fall upon the heads of scoundrels such as M. Colbert . '' 
`` I think so too , '' replied Aramis ; `` but M. Colbert is so very near the king at this moment . '' 
`` That is true , and that would open the succession . '' 
`` Of which your younger brother would reap all the advantage , monseigneur . 
But stay , let us keep quiet , and go on listening . '' 
`` We shall not have long to listen , '' said the young prince . 
`` Why not , monseigneur ? '' 
`` Because , if I were king , I should make no further reply . '' 
`` And what would you do ? '' 
`` I should wait until to-morrow morning to give myself time for reflection . '' 
Louis XIV . 
at last raised his eyes , and finding Colbert attentively waiting for his next remarks , said , hastily , changing the conversation , `` M. Colbert , I perceive it is getting very late , and I shall now retire to bed . 
By to-morrow morning I shall have made up my mind . '' 
`` Very good , sire , '' returned Colbert , greatly incensed , although he restrained himself in the presence of the king . 
The king made a gesture of adieu , and Colbert withdrew with a respectful bow . 
`` My attendants ! '' 
cried the king ; and , as they entered the apartment , Philippe was about to quit his post of observation . 
`` A moment longer , '' said Aramis to him , with his accustomed gentleness of manner ; `` what has just now taken place is only a detail , and to-morrow we shall have no occasion to think anything more about it ; but the ceremony of the king 's retiring to rest , the etiquette observed in addressing the king , that indeed is of the greatest importance . 
Learn , sire , and study well how you ought to go to bed of a night . 
Look ! 
look ! '' 
: Colbert . 
History will tell us , or rather history has told us , of the various events of the following day , of the splendid fetes given by the surintendant to his sovereign . 
Nothing but amusement and delight was allowed to prevail throughout the whole of the following day ; there was a promenade , a banquet , a comedy to be acted , and a comedy , too , in which , to his great amazement , Porthos recognized `` M. Coquelin de Voliere '' as one of the actors , in the piece called `` Les Facheux . '' 
Full of preoccupation , however , from the scene of the previous evening , and hardly recovered from the effects of the poison which Colbert had then administered to him , the king , during the whole of the day , so brilliant in its effects , so full of unexpected and startling novelties , in which all the wonders of the `` Arabian Night 's Entertainments '' seemed to be reproduced for his especial amusement - the king , we say , showed himself cold , reserved , and taciturn . 
Nothing could smooth the frowns upon his face ; every one who observed him noticed that a deep feeling of resentment , of remote origin , increased by slow degrees , as the source becomes a river , thanks to the thousand threads of water that increase its body , was keenly alive in the depths of the king 's heart . 
Towards the middle of the day only did he begin to resume a little serenity of manner , and by that time he had , in all probability , made up his mind . 
Aramis , who followed him step by step in his thoughts , as in his walk , concluded that the event he was expecting would not be long before it was announced . 
This time Colbert seemed to walk in concert with the bishop of Vannes , and had he received for every annoyance which he inflicted on the king a word of direction from Aramis , he could not have done better . 
During the whole of the day the king , who , in all probability , wished to free himself from some of the thoughts which disturbed his mind , seemed to seek La Valliere 's society as actively as he seemed to show his anxiety to flee that of M. Colbert or M. Fouquet . 
The evening came . 
The king had expressed a wish not to walk in the park until after cards in the evening . 
In the interval between supper and the promenade , cards and dice were introduced . 
The king won a thousand pistoles , and , having won them , put them in his pocket , and then rose , saying , `` And now , gentlemen , to the park . '' 
He found the ladies of the court were already there . 
The king , we have before observed , had won a thousand pistoles , and had put them in his pocket ; but M. Fouquet had somehow contrived to lose ten thousand , so that among the courtiers there was still left a hundred and ninety thousand francs ' profit to divide , a circumstance which made the countenances of the courtiers and the officers of the king 's household the most joyous countenances in the world . 
It was not the same , however , with the king 's face ; for , notwithstanding his success at play , to which he was by no means insensible , there still remained a slight shade of dissatisfaction . 
Colbert was waiting for or upon him at the corner of one of the avenues ; he was most probably waiting there in consequence of a rendezvous which had been given him by the king , as Louis XIV. , who had avoided him , or who had seemed to avoid him , suddenly made him a sign , and they then struck into the depths of the park together . 
But La Valliere , too , had observed the king 's gloomy aspect and kindling glances ; she had remarked this - and as nothing which lay hidden or smoldering in his heart was hidden from the gaze of her affection , she understood that this repressed wrath menaced some one ; she prepared to withstand the current of his vengeance , and intercede like an angel of mercy . 
Overcome by sadness , nervously agitated , deeply distressed at having been so long separated from her lover , disturbed at the sight of the emotion she had divined , she accordingly presented herself to the king with an embarrassed aspect , which in his then disposition of mind the king interpreted unfavorably . 
Then , as they were alone - nearly alone , inasmuch as Colbert , as soon as he perceived the young girl approaching , had stopped and drawn back a dozen paces - the king advanced towards La Valliere and took her by the hand . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' he said to her , `` should I be guilty of an indiscretion if I were to inquire if you were indisposed ? 
for you seem to breathe as if you were oppressed by some secret cause of uneasiness , and your eyes are filled with tears . '' 
`` Oh ! 
sire , if I be indeed so , and if my eyes are indeed full of tears , I am sorrowful only at the sadness which seems to oppress your majesty . '' 
`` My sadness ? 
You are mistaken , mademoiselle ; no , it is not sadness I experience . '' 
`` What is it , then , sire ? '' 
`` Humiliation . '' 
`` Humiliation ? 
oh ! 
sire , what a word for you to use ! '' 
`` I mean , mademoiselle , that wherever I may happen to be , no one else ought to be the master . 
Well , then , look round you on every side , and judge whether I am not eclipsed - I , the king of France - before the monarch of these wide domains . 
Oh ! '' 
he continued , clenching his hands and teeth , `` when I think that this king - '' `` Well , sire ? '' 
said Louise , terrified . '' 
- That this king is a faithless , unworthy servant , who grows proud and self-sufficient upon the strength of property that belongs to me , and which he has stolen . 
And therefore I am about to change this impudent minister 's fete into sorrow and mourning , of which the nymph of Vaux , as the poets say , shall not soon lose the remembrance . '' 
`` Oh ! 
your majesty - '' `` Well , mademoiselle , are you about to take M. Fouquet 's part ? '' 
said Louis , impatiently . 
`` No , sire ; I will only ask whether you are well informed . 
Your majesty has more than once learned the value of accusations made at court . '' 
Louis XIV . 
made a sign for Colbert to approach . 
`` Speak , Monsieur Colbert , '' said the young prince , `` for I almost believe that Mademoiselle de la Valliere has need of your assistance before she can put any faith in the king 's word . 
Tell mademoiselle what M. Fouquet has done ; and you , mademoiselle , will perhaps have the kindness to listen . 
It will not be long . '' 
Why did Louis XIV . 
insist upon it in such a manner ? 
A very simple reason - his heart was not at rest , his mind was not thoroughly convinced ; he imagined there lay some dark , hidden , tortuous intrigue behind these thirteen millions of francs ; and he wished that the pure heart of La Valliere , which had revolted at the idea of theft or robbery , should approve - even were it only by a single word - the resolution he had taken , and which , nevertheless , he hesitated before carrying into execution . 
`` Speak , monsieur , '' said La Valliere to Colbert , who had advanced ; `` speak , since the king wishes me to listen to you . 
Tell me , what is the crime with which M. Fouquet is charged ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
not very heinous , mademoiselle , '' he returned , `` a mere abuse of confidence . '' 
`` Speak , speak , Colbert ; and when you have related it , leave us , and go and inform M. d'Artagnan that I have certain orders to give him . '' 
`` M. d'Artagnan , sire ! '' 
exclaimed La Valliere ; `` but why send for M. d'Artagnan ? 
I entreat you to tell me . '' 
`` Pardieu !
