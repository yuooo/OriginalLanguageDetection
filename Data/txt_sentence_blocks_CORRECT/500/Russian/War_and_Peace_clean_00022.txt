Though he is a German -- I congratulate him ! 
I ca n't make out what the commander at Korchevo -- a certain Khandrikov -- is up to ; till now the additional men and provisions have not arrived . 
Gallop off to him at once and say I 'll have his head off if everything is not here in a week . 
Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from Petenka -- he took part in it -- and it 's all true . 
When mischief-makers do n't meddle even a German beats Buonaparte . 
He is said to be fleeing in great disorder . 
Mind you gallop off to Korchevo without delay and carry out instructions ! 
Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope . 
It was a closely written letter of two sheets from Bilibin . 
He folded it up without reading it and reread his father 's letter , ending with the words : `` Gallop off to Korchevo and carry out instructions ! '' 
`` No , pardon me , I wo n't go now till the child is better , '' thought he , going to the door and looking into the nursery . 
Princess Mary was still standing by the cot , gently rocking the baby . 
`` Ah yes , and what else did he say that 's unpleasant ? '' 
thought Prince Andrew , recalling his father 's letter . 
`` Yes , we have gained a victory over Bonaparte , just when I 'm not serving . 
Yes , yes , he 's always poking fun at me ... . 
Ah , well ! 
Let him ! '' 
And he began reading Bilibin 's letter which was written in French . 
He read without understanding half of it , read only to forget , if but for a moment , what he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else . 
Bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity , and though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms , he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and self-derision genuinely Russian . 
Bilibin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented him , and he was happy to have in Prince Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army . 
The letter was old , having been written before the battle at Preussisch-Eylau . 
`` Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz , '' wrote Bilibin , `` as you know , my dear prince , I never leave headquarters . 
I have certainly acquired a taste for war , and it is just as well for me ; what I have seen during these last three months is incredible . 
`` I begin ab ovo . 
` The enemy of the human race , ' as you know , attacks the Prussians . 
The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three years . 
We take up their cause , but it turns out that ` the enemy of the human race ' pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun , and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at Potsdam . '' ' 
I most ardently desire , ' writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte , ` that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself , and in so far as circumstances allowed , I have hastened to take all steps to that end . 
May I have succeeded ! ' 
The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay down their arms at the first demand . 
`` The head of the garrison at Glogau , with ten thousand men , asks the King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender ... . 
All this is absolutely true . 
`` In short , hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude , it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war , and what is more , in war on our own frontiers , with and for the King of Prussia . 
We have everything in perfect order , only one little thing is lacking , namely , a commander in chief . 
As it was considered that the Austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young , all our octogenarians were reviewed , and of Prozorovski and Kamenski the latter was preferred . 
The general comes to us , Suvorov-like , in a kibitka , and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph . 
`` On the 4th , the first courier arrives from Petersburg . 
The mails are taken to the field marshal 's room , for he likes to do everything himself . 
I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us . 
The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him . 
We search , but none are to be found . 
The field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor to Count T. , Prince V. , and others . 
Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything , seizes the letters , opens them , and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others . 
` Ah ! 
So that 's the way they treat me ! 
No confidence in me ! 
Ah , ordered to keep an eye on me ! 
Very well then ! 
Get along with you ! ' 
So he writes the famous order of the day to General Bennigsen : ' I am wounded and can not ride and consequently can not command the army . 
You have brought your army corps to Pultusk , routed : here it is exposed , and without fuel or forage , so something must be done , and , as you yourself reported to Count Buxhowden yesterday , you must think of retreating to our frontier -- which do today . ' '' 
` From all my riding , ' he writes to the Emperor , ' I have got a saddle sore which , coming after all my previous journeys , quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army , so I have passed on the command to the general next in seniority , Count Buxhowden , having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it , advising him if there is a lack of bread , to move farther into the interior of Prussia , for only one day 's ration of bread remains , and in some regiments none at all , as reported by the division commanders , Ostermann and Sedmoretzki , and all that the peasants had has been eaten up . 
I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover . 
In regard to which I humbly submit my report , with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring . '' 
` Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen . 
I shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital , that I may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army . 
My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir -- a blind man has left it . 
There are thousands such as I in Russia . ' 
`` The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all , is n't it logical ? 
`` This is the first act . 
Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining . 
After the field marshal 's departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle . 
Buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority , but General Bennigsen does not quite see it ; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle ` on his own hand ' as the Germans say . 
He does so . 
This is the battle of Pultusk , which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind . 
We civilians , as you know , have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost . 
Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say ; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pultusk . 
In short , we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory , and General Bennigsen , hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory , does not give up the command of the army to General Buxhowden . 
During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers . 
Our aim is no longer , as it should be , to avoid or attack the enemy , but solely to avoid General Buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief . 
So energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy , who at the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhowden . 
General Buxhowden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him . 
Buxhowden pursues us -- we scuttle . 
He hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other . 
At last our enemy . 
Buxhowden , catches us and attacks . 
Both generals are angry , and the result is a challenge on Buxhowden 's part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsen 's . 
But at the critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at Pultusk to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief , and our first foe , Buxhowden , is vanquished ; we can now turn our thoughts to the second , Bonaparte . 
But as it turns out , just at that moment a third enemy rises before us - namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers , loudly demanding bread , meat , biscuits , fodder , and whatnot ! 
The stores are empty , the roads impassable . 
The Orthodox begin looting , and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea . 
Half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword . 
The inhabitants are totally ruined , the hospitals overflow with sick , and famine is everywhere . 
Twice the marauders even attack our headquarters , and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them . 
During one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown . 
The Emperor proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders , but I much fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other . '' 
At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only , but after a while , in spite of himself -LRB- although he knew how far it was safe to trust Bilibin -RRB- , what he had read began to interest him more and more . 
When he had read thus far , he crumpled the letter up and threw it away . 
It was not what he had read that vexed him , but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part could perturb him . 
He shut his eyes , rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read , and listened to what was passing in the nursery . 
Suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the door . 
He was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter . 
He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it . 
Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot . 
`` My dear , '' he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him . 
As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety , he was seized by an unreasoning panic -- it occurred to him that the child was dead . 
All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror . 
`` All is over , '' he thought , and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead . 
He went to the cot in confusion , sure that he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby . 
He drew the curtain aside and for some time his frightened , restless eyes could not find the baby . 
At last he saw him : the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow , and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly . 
Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that , as if he had already lost him . 
He bent over him and , as his sister had taught him , tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish . 
The soft forehead was moist . 
Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand ; even the hair was wet , so profusely had the child perspired . 
He was not dead , but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent . 
Prince Andrew longed to snatch up , to squeeze , to hold to his heart , this helpless little creature , but dared not do so . 
He stood over him , gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket . 
He heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot . 
He did not look round , but still gazing at the infant 's face listened to his regular breathing . 
The dark shadow was Princess Mary , who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps , lifted the curtain , and dropped it again behind her . 
Prince Andrew recognized her without looking and held out his hand to her . 
She pressed it . 
`` He has perspired , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` I was coming to tell you so . '' 
The child moved slightly in his sleep , smiled , and rubbed his forehead against the pillow . 
Prince Andrew looked at his sister . 
In the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that were in them . 
She leaned over to her brother and kissed him , slightly catching the curtain of the cot . 
Each made the other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the world . 
Prince Andrew was the first to move away , ruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain . 
`` Yes , this is the one thing left me now , '' he said with a sigh . 
Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood , Pierre went to the Kiev province , where he had the greatest number of serfs , taking with him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates . 
When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes . 
He told them that steps would be taken immediately to free his serfs -- and that till then they were not to be overburdened with labor , women while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work , assistance was to be given to the serfs , punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal , and hospitals , asylums , and schools were to be established on all the estates . 
Some of the stewards -LRB- there were semiliterate foremen among them -RRB- listened with alarm , supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money , some after their first fright were amused by Pierre 's lisp and the new words they had not heard before , others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked , while the cleverest among them , including the chief steward , understood from this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends . 
The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre 's intentions , but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory . 
Despite Count Bezukhov 's enormous wealth , since he had come into an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year , Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten thousand rubles . 
He had a dim perception of the following budget : About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank , about 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow , the town house , and the allowance to the three princesses ; about 15,000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums ; 150,000 alimony was sent to the countess ; about 70,00 went for interest on debts . 
The building of a new church , previously begun , had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two years , and he did not know how the rest , about 100,000 rubles , was spent , and almost every year he was obliged to borrow . 
Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests , or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops . 
So the first task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclination -- practical business . 
He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward . 
But he felt that this did not forward matters at all . 
He felt that these consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with them or make them move . 
On the one hand , the chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light , pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor , to which Pierre did not agree . 
On the other hand , Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs , which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank , and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation . 
The steward did not say it was quite impossible , but suggested selling the forests in the province of Kostroma , the land lower down the river , and the Crimean estate , in order to make it possible : all of which operations according to him were connected with such complicated measures -- the removal of injunctions , petitions , permits , and so on -- that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied : `` Yes , yes , do so . '' 
Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it . 
The steward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself . 
In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew , and strangers hastened to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer , the largest landowner of the province . 
Temptations to Pierre 's greatest weakness -- the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the Lodge -- were so strong that he could not resist them . 
Again whole days , weeks , and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with evening parties , dinners , lunches , and balls , giving him no time for reflection , as in Petersburg . 
Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old life , only in new surroundings . 
Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral life , and that of the seven virtues he lacked two -- morality and the love of death . 
He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the precepts -- that of reforming the human race - and had other virtues -- love of his neighbor , and especially generosity . 
In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg . 
On the way he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit . 
The chief steward , who considered the young count 's attempts almost insane -- unprofitable to himself , to the count , and to the serfs -- made some concessions . 
Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable , he arranged for the erection of large buildings -- schools , hospitals , and asylums -- on all the estates before the master arrived . 
Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes -LRB- which he knew Pierre would not like -RRB- , but for just such gratefully religious ones , with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality , as , according to his understanding of his master , would touch and delude him . 
The southern spring , the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage , and the solitude of the road , all had a gladdening effect on Pierre . 
The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other ; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them . 
Everywhere were receptions , which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart . 
In one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul , asking permission , as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them , to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul , his patron saints . 
In another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work . 
On a third estate the priest , bearing a cross , came to meet him surrounded by children whom , by the count 's generosity , he was instructing in reading , writing , and religion . 
On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection , all on one plan , for hospitals , schools , and almshouses , which were soon to be opened . 
Everywhere he saw the stewards ' accounts , according to which the serfs ' manorial labor had been diminished , and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats . 
What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter 's day , and that the richest peasants -LRB- who formed the deputation -RRB- had begun the chantry long before , but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty . 
He did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land , they did still harder work on their own land . 
He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions , and that the pupils ' parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments . 
He did not know that the brick buildings , built to plan , were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased , though lessened on paper . 
He did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs ' payments had been diminished by a third , their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half . 
And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg , and wrote enthusiastic letters to his `` brother-instructor '' as he called the Grand Master . 
`` How easy it is , how little effort it needs , to do so much good , '' thought Pierre , `` and how little attention we pay to it ! '' 
He was pleased at the gratitude he received , but felt abashed at receiving it . 
This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple , kindly people . 
The chief steward , a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy , seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre , pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs , who were quite happy as it was . 
Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people , and that God only knew what would happen to them when they were free , but he insisted , though reluctantly , on what he thought right . 
The steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the count 's wishes , seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank , but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all that other people 's serfs gave -- that is to say , all that could be got out of them . 
Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state of mind , Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his friend Bolkonski , whom he had not seen for two years . 
Bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields and forests of fir and birch , which were partly cut down . 
The house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass . 
It was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees . 
The homestead consisted of a threshing floor , outhouses , stables , a bathhouse , a lodge , and a large brick house with semicircular facade still in course of construction . 
Round the house was a garden newly laid out . 
The fences and gates were new and solid ; two fire pumps and a water cart , painted green , stood in a shed ; the paths were straight , the bridges were strong and had handrails . 
Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management . 
Some domestic serfs Pierre met , in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived , pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the pond . 
Anton , a man who had looked after Prince Andrew in his boyhood , helped Pierre out of his carriage , said that the prince was at home , and showed him into a clean little anteroom . 
Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in Petersburg . 
He quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered wooden walls redolent of pine , and would have gone farther , but Anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door . 
`` Well , what is it ? '' 
came a sharp , unpleasant voice . 
`` A visitor , '' answered Anton . 
`` Ask him to wait , '' and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back . 
Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with Prince Andrew , who came out frowning and looking old . 
Pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely . 
`` Well , I did not expect you , I am very glad , '' said Prince Andrew . 
Pierre said nothing ; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise . 
He was struck by the change in him . 
His words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face , but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle . 
Prince Andrew had grown thinner , paler , and more manly-looking , but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought . 
As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation , it was long before their conversation could settle on anything . 
They put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length . 
At last the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on : their past life , plans for the future , Pierre 's journeys and occupations , the war , and so on . 
The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend 's look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre , especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future . 
It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying , but could not . 
The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms , dreams , and hopes of happiness or goodness , in Prince Andrew 's presence . 
He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views , which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour . 
He checked himself , fearing to seem naive , yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different , and better , Pierre than he had been in Petersburg . 
`` I ca n't tell you how much I have lived through since then . 
I hardly know myself again . '' 
`` Yes , we have altered much , very much , since then , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Well , and you ? 
What are your plans ? '' 
`` Plans ! '' 
repeated Prince Andrew ironically . 
`` My plans ? '' 
he said , as if astonished at the word . 
`` Well , you see , I 'm building . 
I mean to settle here altogether next year ... '' Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew 's face , which had grown much older . 
`` No , I meant to ask ... '' Pierre began , but Prince Andrew interrupted him . 
`` But why talk of me ? 
... Talk to me , yes , tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates . '' 
Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates , trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made . 
Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre 's story of what he had been doing , as though it were all an old-time story , and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him . 
Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend 's company and at last became silent . 
`` I 'll tell you what , my dear fellow , '' said Prince Andrew , who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor , `` I am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round . 
I am going back to my sister today . 
I will introduce you to her . 
But of course you know her already , '' he said , evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common . 
`` We will go after dinner . 
And would you now like to look round my place ? '' 
They went out and walked about till dinnertime , talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately . 
Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings , but even here , while on the scaffolding , in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house , he interrupted himself : `` However , this is not at all interesting . 
Let us have dinner , and then we 'll set off . '' 
At dinner , conversation turned on Pierre 's marriage . 
`` I was very much surprised when I heard of it , '' said Prince Andrew . 
Pierre blushed , as he always did when it was mentioned , and said hurriedly : `` I will tell you some time how it all happened . 
But you know it is all over , and forever . '' 
`` Forever ? '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` Nothing 's forever . '' 
`` But you know how it all ended , do n't you ? 
You heard of the duel ? '' 
`` And so you had to go through that too ! '' 
`` One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man , '' said Pierre . 
`` Why so ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew . 
`` To kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really . '' 
`` No , to kill a man is bad -- wrong . '' 
`` Why is it wrong ? '' 
urged Prince Andrew . 
`` It is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong . 
Men always did and always will err , and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong . '' 
`` What does harm to another is wrong , '' said Pierre , feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused , had begun to talk , and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state . 
`` And who has told you what is bad for another man ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Bad ! 
Bad ! '' 
exclaimed Pierre . 
`` We all know what is bad for ourselves . '' 
`` Yes , we know that , but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I can not inflict on others , '' said Prince Andrew , growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre . 
He spoke in French . 
`` I only know two very real evils in life : remorse and illness . 
The only good is the absence of those evils . 
To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now . '' 
`` And love of one 's neighbor , and self-sacrifice ? '' 
began Pierre . 
`` No , I ca n't agree with you ! 
To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough . 
I lived like that , I lived for myself and ruined my life . 
And only now when I am living , or at least trying '' -LRB- Pierre 's modesty made him correct himself -RRB- `` to live for others , only now have I understood all the happiness of life . 
No , I shall not agree with you , and you do not really believe what you are saying . '' 
Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile . 
`` When you see my sister , Princess Mary , you 'll get on with her , '' he said . 
`` Perhaps you are right for yourself , '' he added after a short pause , `` but everyone lives in his own way . 
You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others . 
I experienced just the reverse . 
I lived for glory . 
-- And after all what is glory ? 
The same love of others , a desire to do something for them , a desire for their approval . 
-- So I lived for others , and not almost , but quite , ruined my life . 
And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself . '' 
`` But what do you mean by living only for yourself ? '' 
asked Pierre , growing excited . 
`` What about your son , your sister , and your father ? '' 
`` But that 's just the same as myself -- they are not others , '' explained Prince Andrew . 
`` The others , one 's neighbors , le prochain , as you and Princess Mary call it , are the chief source of all error and evil . 
Le prochain -- your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good . '' 
And he looked at Pierre with a mocking , challenging expression . 
He evidently wished to draw him on . 
`` You are joking , '' replied Pierre , growing more and more excited . 
`` What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good , and even doing a little -- though I did very little and did it very badly ? 
What evil can there be in it if unfortunate people , our serfs , people like ourselves , were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life , retribution , recompense , and consolation ? 
What evil and error are there in it , if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered , and I supplied them with a doctor , a hospital , and an asylum for the aged ? 
And is it not a palpable , unquestionable good if a peasant , or a woman with a baby , has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure ? '' 
said Pierre , hurrying and lisping . 
`` And I have done that though badly and to a small extent ; but I have done something toward it and you can not persuade me that it was not a good action , and more than that , you ca n't make me believe that you do not think so yourself . 
And the main thing is , '' he continued , `` that I know , and know for certain , that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life . '' 
`` Yes , if you put it like that it 's quite a different matter , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` I build a house and lay out a garden , and you build hospitals . 
The one and the other may serve as a pastime . 
But what 's right and what 's good must be judged by one who knows all , but not by us . 
Well , you want an argument , '' he added , `` come on then . '' 
They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda . 
`` Come , let 's argue then , '' said Prince Andrew , `` You talk of schools , '' he went on , crooking a finger , `` education and so forth ; that is , you want to raise him '' -LRB- pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap -RRB- `` from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs , while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible , and that is just what you want to deprive him of . 
I envy him , but you want to make him what I am , without giving him my means . 
Then you say , ` lighten his toil . ' 
But as I see it , physical labor is as essential to him , as much a condition of his existence , as mental activity is to you or me . 
You ca n't help thinking . 
I go to bed after two in the morning , thoughts come and I ca n't sleep but toss about till dawn , because I think and ca n't help thinking , just as he ca n't help plowing and mowing ; if he did n't , he would go to the drink shop or fall ill . 
Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week , so he could not stand my physical idleness , but would grow fat and die . 
The third thing -- what else was it you talked about ? '' 
and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger . 
`` Ah , yes , hospitals , medicine . 
He has a fit , he is dying , and you come and bleed him and patch him up . 
He will drag about as a cripple , a burden to everybody , for another ten years . 
It would be far easier and simpler for him to die . 
Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is . 
It would be different if you grudged losing a laborer -- that 's how I regard him -- but you want to cure him from love of him . 
And he does not want that . 
And besides , what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone ! 
Killed them , yes ! '' 
said he , frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre . 
Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once , and he spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time . 
His glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless . 
`` Oh , that is dreadful , dreadful ! '' 
said Pierre . 
`` I do n't understand how one can live with such ideas . 
I had such moments myself not long ago , in Moscow and when traveling , but at such times I collapsed so that I do n't live at all -- everything seems hateful to me ... myself most of all . 
Then I do n't eat , do n't wash ... and how is it with you ? 
... '' `` Why not wash ? 
That is not cleanly , '' said Prince Andrew ; `` on the contrary one must try to make one 's life as pleasant as possible . 
I 'm alive , that is not my fault , so I must live out my life as best I can without hurting others . '' 
`` But with such ideas what motive have you for living ? 
One would sit without moving , undertaking nothing ... '' `` Life as it is leaves one no peace . 
I should be thankful to do nothing , but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal ; it was all I could do to get out of it . 
They could not understand that I have not the necessary qualifications for it -- the kind of good-natured , fussy shallowness necessary for the position . 
Then there 's this house , which must be built in order to have a nook of one 's own in which to be quiet . 
And now there 's this recruiting . '' 
`` Why are n't you serving in the army ? '' 
`` After Austerlitz ! '' 
said Prince Andrew gloomily . 
`` No , thank you very much ! 
I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian army . 
And I wo n't -- not even if Bonaparte were here at Smolensk threatening Bald Hills -- even then I would n't serve in the Russian army ! 
Well , as I was saying , '' he continued , recovering his composure , `` now there 's this recruiting . 
My father is chief in command of the Third District , and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him . '' 
`` Then you are serving ? '' 
`` I am . '' 
He paused a little while . 
`` And why do you serve ? '' 
`` Why , for this reason ! 
My father is one of the most remarkable men of his time . 
But he is growing old , and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character . 
He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible , and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting , granted by the Emperor . 
If I had been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster 's clerk at Yukhnovna hanged , '' said Prince Andrew with a smile . 
`` So I am serving because I alone have any influence with my father , and now and then can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards . '' 
`` Well , there you see ! '' 
`` Yes , but it is not as you imagine , '' Prince Andrew continued . 
`` I did not , and do not , in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits ; I should even have been very glad to see him hanged , but I was sorry for my father -- that again is for myself . '' 
Prince Andrew grew more and more animated . 
His eyes glittered feverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no desire to do good to his neighbor . 
`` There now , you wish to liberate your serfs , '' he continued ; `` that is a very good thing , but not for you -- I do n't suppose you ever had anyone flogged or sent to Siberia -- and still less for your serfs . 
If they are beaten , flogged , or sent to Siberia , I do n't suppose they are any the worse off . 
In Siberia they lead the same animal life , and the stripes on their bodies heal , and they are happy as before . 
But it is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally , bring remorse upon themselves , stifle this remorse and grow callous , as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly . 
It is those people I pity , and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs . 
You may not have seen , but I have seen , how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power , in time when they grow more irritable , become cruel and harsh , are conscious of it , but can not restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable . '' 
Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his father 's case . 
He did not reply . 
`` So that 's what I 'm sorry for -- human dignity , peace of mind , purity , and not the serfs ' backs and foreheads , which , beat and shave as you may , always remain the same backs and foreheads . '' 
`` No , no ! 
A thousand times no ! 
I shall never agree with you , '' said Pierre . 
In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to Bald Hills . 
Prince Andrew , glancing at Pierre , broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper . 
Pointing to the fields , he spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry . 
Pierre remained gloomily silent , answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts . 
He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy , had gone astray , did not see the true light , and that he , Pierre , ought to aid , enlighten , and raise him . 
But as soon as he thought of what he should say , he felt that Prince Andrew with one word , one argument , would upset all his teaching , and he shrank from beginning , afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred . 
`` No , but why do you think so ? '' 
Pierre suddenly began , lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge , `` why do you think so ? 
You should not think so . '' 
`` Think ? 
What about ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew with surprise . 
`` About life , about man 's destiny . 
It ca n't be so . 
I myself thought like that , and do you know what saved me ? 
Freemasonry ! 
No , do n't smile . 
Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect , as I thought it was : Freemasonry is the best expression of the best , the eternal , aspects of humanity . '' 
And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew . 
He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of State and Church , a teaching of equality , brotherhood , and love . 
`` Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life , all the rest is a dream , '' said Pierre . 
`` Understand , my dear fellow , that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life , like you , merely trying not to harm others . 
But make our fundamental convictions your own , join our brotherhood , give yourself up to us , let yourself be guided , and you will at once feel yourself , as I have felt myself , a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven , '' said Pierre . 
Prince Andrew , looking straight in front of him , listened in silence to Pierre 's words . 
More than once , when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what Pierre said , he asked him to repeat it , and by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew 's eyes and by his silence , Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said . 
They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to cross by ferry . 
While the carriage and horses were being placed on it , they also stepped on the raft . 
Prince Andrew , leaning his arms on the raft railing , gazed silently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun . 
`` Well , what do you think about it ? '' 
Pierre asked . 
`` Why are you silent ? '' 
`` What do I think about it ? 
I am listening to you . 
It 's all very well ... . 
You say : join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life , the destiny of man , and the laws which govern the world . 
But who are we ? 
Men . 
How is it you know everything ? 
Why do I alone not see what you see ? 
You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth , but I do n't see it . '' 
Pierre interrupted him . 
`` Do you believe in a future life ? '' 
he asked . 
`` A future life ? '' 
Prince Andrew repeated , but Pierre , giving him no time to reply , took the repetition for a denial , the more readily as he knew Prince Andrew 's former atheistic convictions . 
`` You say you ca n't see a reign of goodness and truth on earth . 
Nor could I , and it can not be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of everything . 
On earth , here on this earth '' -LRB- Pierre pointed to the fields -RRB- , `` there is no truth , all is false and evil ; but in the universe , in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth , and we who are now the children of earth are -- eternally -- children of the whole universe . 
Do n't I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole ? 
Do n't I feel that I form one link , one step , between the lower and higher beings , in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the Deity -- the Supreme Power if you prefer the term -- is manifest ? 
If I see , clearly see , that ladder leading from plant to man , why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther ? 
I feel that I can not vanish , since nothing vanishes in this world , but that I shall always exist and always have existed . 
I feel that beyond me and above me there are spirits , and that in this world there is truth . '' 
`` Yes , that is Herder 's theory , '' said Prince Andrew , `` but it is not that which can convince me , dear friend -- life and death are what convince . 
What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one , bound up with one 's own life , before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right '' -LRB- Prince Andrew 's voice trembled and he turned away -RRB- , `` and suddenly that being is seized with pain , suffers , and ceases to exist ... . 
Why ? 
It can not be that there is no answer . 
And I believe there is ... . 
That 's what convinces , that is what has convinced me , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Yes , yes , of course , '' said Pierre , `` is n't that what I 'm saying ? '' 
`` No . 
All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the necessity of a future life , but this : when you go hand in hand with someone and all at once that person vanishes there , into nowhere , and you yourself are left facing that abyss , and look in . 
And I have looked in ... '' `` Well , that 's it then ! 
You know that there is a there and there is a Someone ? 
There is the future life . 
The Someone is -- God . '' 
Prince Andrew did not reply . 
The carriage and horses had long since been taken off , onto the farther bank , and reharnessed . 
The sun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the ferry , but Pierre and Andrew , to the astonishment of the footmen , coachmen , and ferrymen , still stood on the raft and talked . 
`` If there is a God and future life , there is truth and good , and man 's highest happiness consists in striving to attain them . 
We must live , we must love , and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap of earth , but have lived and shall live forever , there , in the Whole , '' said Pierre , and he pointed to the sky . 
Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre , and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters . 
There was perfect stillness . 
Pierre became silent . 
The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below . 
Prince Andrew felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre 's words , whispering : `` It is true , believe it . '' 
He sighed , and glanced with a radiant , childlike , tender look at Pierre 's face , flushed and rapturous , but yet shy before his superior friend . 
`` Yes , if it only were so ! '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` However , it is time to get on , '' he added , and , stepping off the raft , he looked up at the sky to which Pierre had pointed , and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that high , everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield ; and something that had long been slumbering , something that was best within him , suddenly awoke , joyful and youthful , in his soul . 
It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life , but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him . 
His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrew 's life . 
Though outwardly he continued to live in the same old way , inwardly he began a new life . 
It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front entrance of the house at Bald Hills . 
As they approached the house , Prince Andrew with asmile drew Pierre 's attention to a commotion going on at the back porch . 
A woman , bent with age , with a wallet on her back , and a short , long-haired , young man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up . 
Two women ran out after them , and all four , looking round at the carriage , ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch . 
`` Those are Mary 's ` God 's folk , ' '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` They have mistaken us for my father . 
This is the one matter in which she disobeys him . 
He orders these pilgrims to be driven away , but she receives them . '' 
`` But what are ` God 's folk ' ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
Prince Andrew had no time to answer . 
The servants came out to meet them , and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon . 
The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute . 
Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments , which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father 's house ; he himself went to the nursery . 
`` Let us go and see my sister , '' he said to Pierre when he returned . 
`` I have not found her yet , she is hiding now , sitting with her ` God 's folk . ' 
It will serve her right , she will be confused , but you will see her ` God 's folk . ' 
It 's really very curious . '' 
`` What are ` God 's folk ' ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` Come , and you 'll see for yourself . '' 
Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face when they went in . 
In her snug room , with lamps burning before the icon stand , a young lad with a long nose and long hair , wearing a monk 's cassock , sat on the sofa beside her , behind a samovar . 
Near them , in an armchair , sat a thin , shriveled , old woman , with a meek expression on her childlike face . 
`` Andrew , why did n't you warn me ? '' 
said the princess , with mild reproach , as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens . 
`` Charmee de vous voir . 
Je suis tres contente de vous voir , '' * she said to Pierre as he kissed her hand . 
She had known him as a child , and now his friendship with Andrew , his misfortune with his wife , and above all his kindly , simple face disposed her favorably toward him . 
She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say , `` I like you very much , but please do n't laugh at my people . '' 
After exchanging the first greetings , they sat down . 
* `` Delighted to see you . 
I am very glad to see you . '' 
`` Ah , and Ivanushka is here too ! '' 
said Prince Andrew , glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim . 
`` Andrew ! '' 
said Princess Mary , imploringly . 
`` Il faut que vous sachiez que c'est une femme , '' * said Prince Andrew to Pierre . 
`` Andrew , au nom de Dieu ! '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- Princess Mary repeated . 
* `` You must know that this is a woman . '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- `` For heaven 's sake . '' 
It was evident that Prince Andrew 's ironical tone toward the pilgrims and Princess Mary 's helpless attempts to protect them were their customary long-established relations on the matter . 
`` Mais , ma bonne amie , '' said Prince Andrew , `` vous devriez au contraire m ` etre reconnaissante de ce que j' explique a Pierre votre intimite avec ce jeune homme . '' 
* * `` But , my dear , you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young man . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
said Pierre , gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and seriousness -LRB- for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him -RRB- into Ivanushka 's face , who , seeing that she was being spoken about , looked round at them all with crafty eyes .
