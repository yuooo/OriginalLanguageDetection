Here 's your money ... because I am in great need of them ... and I have n't a minute , a minute to spare . '' 
And taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` But I sha n't have change enough . 
Have n't you less ? '' 
`` No , '' said Mitya , looking again at the bundle , and as though not trusting his own words he turned over two or three of the topmost ones . 
`` No , they 're all alike , '' he added , and again he looked inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` How have you grown so rich ? '' 
the latter asked . 
`` Wait , I 'll send my boy to Plotnikov 's , they close late - to see if they wo n't change it . 
Here , Misha ! '' 
he called into the passage . 
`` To Plotnikov 's shop - first-rate ! '' 
cried Mitya , as though struck by an idea . 
`` Misha , '' he turned to the boy as he came in , `` look here , run to Plotnikov 's and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch sends his greetings , and will be there directly ... . 
But listen , listen , tell them to have champagne , three dozen bottles , ready before I come , and packed as it was to take to Mokroe . 
I took four dozen with me then , '' he added -LRB- suddenly addressing Pyotr Ilyitch -RRB- ; `` they know all about it , do n't you trouble , Misha , '' he turned again to the boy . 
`` Stay , listen ; tell them to put in cheese , Strasburg pies , smoked fish , ham , caviare , and everything , everything they 've got , up to a hundred roubles , or a hundred and twenty as before ... . 
But wait : do n't let them forget dessert , sweets , pears , watermelons , two or three or four - no , one melon 's enough , and chocolate , candy , toffee , fondants ; in fact , everything I took to Mokroe before , three hundred roubles ' worth with the champagne ... let it be just the same again . 
And remember , Misha , if you are called Misha - His name is Misha , is n't it ? '' 
He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again . 
`` Wait a minute , '' Pyotr Ilyitch intervened listening and watching him uneasily , `` you 'd better go yourself and tell them . 
He 'll muddle it . '' 
`` He will , I see he will ! 
Eh , Misha ! 
Why , I was going to kiss you for the commission ... . 
If you do n't make a mistake , there 's ten roubles for you , run along , make haste ... . 
Champagne 's the chief thing , let them bring up champagne . 
And brandy , too , and red and white wine , and all I had then ... . 
They know what I had then . '' 
`` But listen ! '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience . 
`` I say , let him simply run and change the money and tell them not to close , and you go and tell them ... . 
Give him your note . 
Be off , Misha ! 
Put your best leg forward ! '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose , because the boy remained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open , apparently understanding little of Mitya 's orders , gazing up with amazement and terror at his bloodstained face and the trembling blood-stained fingers that held the notes . 
`` Well , now come and wash , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly . 
`` Put the money on the table or else in your pocket ... . 
That 's right , come along . 
But take off your coat . '' 
And beginning to help him off with his coat , he cried out again : `` Look , your coat 's covered with blood , too ! '' 
`` That ... it 's not the coat . 
It 's only a little here on the sleeve ... . 
And that 's only here where the handkerchief lay . 
It must have soaked through . 
I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya 's , and the blood 's come through , '' Mitya explained at once with a child-like unconsciousness that was astounding . 
Pyotr Ilyitch listened , frowning . 
`` Well , you must have been up to something ; you must have been fighting with someone , '' he muttered . 
They began to wash . 
Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the water . 
Mitya , in desperate haste , scarcely soaped his hands -LRB- they were trembling , and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards -RRB- . 
But the young official insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more . 
He seemed to exercise more and more sway over Mitya , as time went on . 
It may be noted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character . 
`` Look , you have n't got your nails clean . 
Now rub your face ; here , on your temples , by your ear ... . 
Will you go in that shirt ? 
Where are you going ? 
Look , all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood . '' 
`` Yes , it 's all bloody , '' observed Mitya , looking at the cuff of his shirt . 
`` Then change your shirt . '' 
`` I have n't time . 
You see I 'll ... '' Mitya went on with the same confiding ingenuousness , drying his face and hands on the towel , and putting on his coat . 
`` I 'll turn it up at the wrist . 
It wo n't be seen under the coat ... . 
You see ! '' 
`` Tell me now , what game have you been up to ? 
Have you been fighting with someone ? 
In the tavern again , as before ? 
Have you been beating that captain again ? '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully . 
`` Whom have you been beating now ... or killing , perhaps ? '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
said Mitya . 
`` Do n't worry , '' said Mitya , and he suddenly laughed . 
`` I smashed an old woman in the market-place just now . '' 
`` Smashed ? 
An old woman ? '' 
`` An old man ! '' 
cried Mitya , looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face , laughing , and shouting at him as though he were deaf . 
`` Confound it ! 
An old woman , an old man ... . 
Have you killed someone ? '' 
`` We made it up . 
We had a row - and made it up . 
In a place I know of . 
We parted friends . 
A fool ... . 
He 's forgiven me ... . 
He 's sure to have forgiven me by now ... if he had got up , he would n't have forgiven me '' - Mitya suddenly winked - `` only damn him , you know , I say , Pyotr Ilyitch , damn him ! 
Do n't worry about him ! 
I do n't want to just now ! '' 
Mitya snapped out , resolutely . 
`` Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with everyone for ? 
... Just as you did with that captain over some nonsense ... . 
You 've been fighting and now you 're rushing off on the spree - that 's you all over ! 
Three dozen champagne - what do you want all that for ? '' 
`` Bravo ! 
Now give me the pistols . 
Upon my honour I 've no time now . 
I should like to have a chat with you , my dear boy , but I have n't the time . 
And there 's no need , it 's too late for talking . 
Where 's my money ? 
Where have I put it ? '' 
he cried , thrusting his hands into his pockets . 
`` You put it on the table ... yourself ... . 
Here it is . 
Had you forgotten ? 
Money 's like dirt or water to you , it seems . 
Here are your pistols . 
It 's an odd thing , at six o'clock you pledged them for ten roubles , and now you 've got thousands . 
Two or three I should say . '' 
`` Three , you bet , '' laughed Mitya , stuffing the notes into the side-pocket of his trousers . 
`` You 'll lose it like that . 
Have you found a gold mine ? '' 
`` The mines ? 
The gold mines ? '' 
Mitya shouted at the top of his voice and went off into a roar of laughter . 
`` Would you like to go to the mines , Perhotin ? 
There 's a lady here who 'll stump up three thousand for you , if only you 'll go . 
She did it for me , she 's so awfully fond of gold mines . 
Do you know Madame Hohlakov ? '' 
`` I do n't know her , but I 've heard of her and seen her . 
Did she really give you three thousand ? 
Did she really ? '' 
said Pyotr Ilyitch , eyeing him dubiously . 
`` As soon as the sun rises to-morrow , as soon as Phoebus , ever young , flies upwards , praising and glorifying God , you go to her , this Madame Hohlakov , and ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or not . 
Try and find out . '' 
`` I do n't know on what terms you are ... since you say it so positively , I suppose she did give it to you . 
You 've got the money in your hand , but instead of going to Siberia you 're spending it all ... . 
Where are you really off to now , eh ? '' 
`` To Mokroe . '' 
`` To Mokroe ? 
But it 's night ! '' 
`` Once the lad had all , now the lad has naught , '' cried Mitya suddenly . 
`` How ` naught ' ? 
You say that with all those thousands ! '' 
`` I 'm not talking about thousands . 
Damn thousands ! 
I 'm talking of female character . 
Fickle is the heart of woman Treacherous and full of vice ; I agree with Ulysses . 
That 's what he says . '' 
`` I do n't understand you ! '' 
`` Am I drunk ? '' 
`` Not drunk , but worse . '' 
`` I 'm drunk in spirit , Pyotr Ilyitch , drunk in spirit ! 
But that 's enough ! '' 
`` What are you doing , loading the pistol ? '' 
`` I 'm loading the pistol . '' 
Unfastening the pistol-case , Mitya actually opened the powder horn , and carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge . 
Then he took the bullet and , before inserting it , held it in two fingers in front of the candle . 
`` Why are you looking at the bullet ? '' 
asked Pyotr Ilyitch , watching him with uneasy curiosity . 
`` Oh , a fancy . 
Why , if you meant to put that bullet in your brain , would you look at it or not ? '' 
`` Why look at it ? '' 
`` It 's going into my brain , so it 's interesting to look and see what it 's like . 
But that 's foolishness , a moment 's foolishness . 
Now that 's done , '' he added , putting in the bullet and driving it home with the ramrod . 
`` Pyotr Ilyitch , my dear fellow , that 's nonsense , all nonsense , and if only you knew what nonsense ! 
Give me a little piece of paper now . '' 
`` Here 's some paper . '' 
`` No , a clean new piece , writing-paper . 
That 's right . '' 
And taking a pen from the table , Mitya rapidly wrote two lines , folded the paper in four , and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket . 
He put the pistols in the case , locked it up , and kept it in his hand . 
Then he looked at Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow , thoughtful smile . 
`` Now , let 's go . '' 
`` Where are we going ? 
No , wait a minute ... . 
Are you thinking of putting that bullet in your brain , perhaps ? '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch asked uneasily . 
`` I was fooling about the bullet ! 
I want to live . 
I love life , You may be sure of that . 
I love golden-haired Phorbus and his warm light ... . 
Dear Pyotr Ilyitch , do you know how to step aside ? '' 
`` What do you mean by ` stepping aside ' ? '' 
`` Making way . 
Making way for a dear creature , and for one I hate . 
And to let the one I hate become dear - that 's what making way means ! 
And to say to them : God bless you , go your way , pass on , while I - '' `` While you - ? '' 
`` That 's enough , let 's go . '' 
`` Upon my word . 
I 'll tell someone to prevent your going there , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch , looking at him . 
`` What are you going to Mokroe for , now ? '' 
`` There 's a woman there , a woman . 
That 's enough for you . 
You shut up . '' 
`` Listen , though you 're such a savage I 've always liked you ... . 
I feel anxious . '' 
`` Thanks , old fellow . 
I 'm a savage you say . 
Savages , savages ! 
That 's what I am always saying . 
Savages ! 
Why , here 's Misha ! 
I was forgetting him . '' 
Misha ran in , post-haste , with a handful of notes in change , and reported that everyone was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs ' ; `` They 're carrying down the bottles , and the fish , and the tea ; it will all be ready directly . '' 
Mitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr Ilyitch , then tossed another ten-rouble note to Misha . 
`` Do n't dare to do such a thing ! '' 
cried Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` I wo n't have it in my house , it 's a bad , demoralising habit . 
Put your money away . 
Here , put it here , why waste it ? 
It would come in handy to-morrow , and I dare say you 'll be coming to me to borrow ten roubles again . 
Why do you keep putting the notes in your side pocket ? 
Ah , you 'll lose them ! '' 
`` I say , my dear fellow , let 's go to Mokroe together . '' 
`` What should I go for ? '' 
`` I say , let 's open a bottle at once , and drink to life ! 
I want to drink , and especially to drink with you . 
I 've never drunk with you , have I ? '' 
`` Very well , we can go to the Metropolis . 
I was just going there . '' 
`` I have n't time for that . 
Let 's drink at the Plotnikovs ' , in the back room . 
Shall I ask you a riddle ? '' 
`` Ask away . '' 
Mitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket , unfolded it and showed it . 
In a large , distinct hand was written : `` I punish myself for my whole life ; my whole life I punish ! '' 
`` I will certainly speak to someone . 
I 'll go at once , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch , after reading the paper . 
`` You wo n't have time , dear boy , come and have a drink . 
March ! '' 
Plotnikov 's shop was at the corner of the street , next door but one to Pyotr Ilyitch 's . 
It was the largest grocery shop in our town , and by no means a bad one , belonging to some rich merchants . 
They kept everything that could be got in a Petersburg shop , grocery of all sort , wines `` bottled by the brothers Eliseyev , '' fruits , cigars , tea , coffee , sugar , and so on . 
There were three shop-assistants and two errand boys always employed . 
Though our part of the country had grown poorer , the landowners had gone away , and trade had got worse , yet the grocery stores flourished as before , every year with increasing prosperity ; there were plenty of purchasers for their goods . 
They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop . 
They had vivid recollections of how he had bought , three or four weeks ago , wine and goods of all sorts to the value of several hundred roubles , paid for in cash -LRB- they would never have let him have anything on credit , of course -RRB- . 
They remembered that then , as now , he had had a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand , and had scattered them at random , without bargaining , without reflecting , or caring to reflect what use so much wine and provisions would be to him . 
The story was told all over the town that , driving off then with Grushenka to Mokroe , he had `` spent three thousand in one night and the following day , and had come back from the spree without a penny . '' 
He had picked up a whole troop of gypsies -LRB- encamped in our neighbourhood at the time -RRB- , who for two days got money without stint out of him while he was drunk , and drank expensive wine without stint . 
People used to tell , laughing at Mitya , how he had given champagne to grimy-handed peasants , and feasted the village women and girls on sweets and Strasburg pies . 
Though to laugh at Mitya to his face was rather a risky proceeding , there was much laughter behind his back , especially in the tavern , at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out of Grushenka by this `` escapade '' was `` permission to kiss her foot , and that was the utmost she had allowed him . '' 
By the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop , they found a cart with three horses harnessed abreast with bells , and with Andrey , the driver , ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance . 
In the shop they had almost entirely finished packing one box of provisions , and were only waiting for Mitya 's arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart . 
Pyotr Ilyitch was astounded . 
`` Where did this cart come from in such a hurry ? '' 
he asked Mitya . 
`` I met Andrey as I ran to you , and told him to drive straight here to the shop . 
There 's no time to lose . 
Last time I drove with Timofey , but Timofey now has gone on before me with the witch . 
Shall we be very late , Andrey ? '' 
`` They 'll only get there an hour at most before us , not even that maybe . 
I got Timofey ready to start . 
I know how he 'll go . 
Their pace wo n't be ours , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
How could it be ? 
They wo n't get there an hour earlier ! '' 
Andrey , a lanky , red-haired , middle-aged driver , wearing a full-skirted coat , and with a kaftan on his arm , replied warmly . 
`` Fifty roubles for vodka if we 're only an hour behind them . '' 
`` I warrant the time , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
Ech , they wo n't be half an hour before us , let alone an hour . '' 
Though Mitya bustled about seeing after things , he gave his orders strangely , as it were , disconnectedly , and inconsecutively . 
He began a sentence and forgot the end of it . 
Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged to come to the rescue . 
`` Four hundred roubles ' worth , not less than four hundred roubles ' worth , just as it was then , '' commanded Mitya . 
`` Four dozen champagne , not a bottle less . '' 
`` What do you want with so much ? 
What 's it for ? 
Stay ! '' 
cried Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` What 's this box ? 
What 's in it ? 
Surely there is n't four hundred roubles ' worth here ? '' 
The officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the first box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne , and only `` the most indispensable articles , '' such as savouries , sweets , toffee , etc. . 
But the main part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent off , as on the previous occasion , in a special cart also with three horses travelling at full speed , so that it would arrive not more than an hour later than Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself . 
`` Not more than an hour ! 
Not more than an hour ! 
And put in more toffee and fondants . 
The girls there are so fond of it , '' Mitya insisted hotly . 
`` The fondants are all right . 
But what do you want with four dozen of champagne ? 
One would be enough , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch , almost angry . 
He began bargaining , asking for a bill of the goods , and refused to be satisfied . 
But he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles . 
In the end it was agreed that only three hundred roubles ' worth should be sent . 
`` Well , you may go to the devil ! '' 
cried Pyotr Ilyitch , on second thoughts . 
`` What 's it to do with me ? 
Throw away your money , since it 's cost you nothing . '' 
`` This way , my economist , this way , do n't be angry . '' 
Mitya drew him into a room at the back of the shop . 
`` They 'll give us a bottle here directly . 
We 'll taste it . 
Ech , Pyotr Ilyitch , come along with me , for you 're a nice fellow , the sort I like . '' 
Mitya sat down on a wicker chair , before a little table , covered with a dirty dinner-napkin . 
Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite , and the champagne soon appeared , and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen . 
`` First-class oysters , the last lot in . '' 
`` Hang the oysters . 
I do n't eat them . 
And we do n't need anything , '' cried Pyotr Ilyitch , almost angrily . 
`` There 's no time for oysters , '' said Mitya . 
`` And I 'm not hungry . 
Do you know , friend , '' he said suddenly , with feeling , `` I never have liked all this disorder . '' 
`` Who does like it ? 
Three dozen of champagne for peasants , upon my word , that 's enough to make anyone angry ! '' 
`` That 's not what I mean . 
I 'm talking of a higher order . 
There 's no order in me , no higher order . 
But ... that 's all over . 
There 's no need to grieve about it . 
It 's too late , damn it ! 
My whole life has been disorder , and one must set it in order . 
Is that a pun , eh ? '' 
`` You 're raving , not making puns ! 
`` Glory be to God in Heaven , Glory be to God in me ... `` That verse came from my heart once , it 's not a verse , but a tear ... . 
I made it myself ... not while I was pulling the captain 's beard , though ... '' `` Why do you bring him in all of a sudden ? '' 
`` Why do I bring him in ? 
Foolery ! 
All things come to an end ; all things are made equal . 
That 's the long and short of it . '' 
`` You know , I keep thinking of your pistols . '' 
`` That 's all foolery , too ! 
Drink , and do n't be fanciful . 
I love life . 
I 've loved life too much , shamefully much . 
Enough ! 
Let 's drink to life , dear boy , I propose the toast . 
Why am I pleased with myself ? 
I 'm a scoundrel , but I 'm satisfied with myself . 
And yet I 'm tortured by the thought that I 'm a scoundrel , but satisfied with myself . 
I bless the creation . 
I 'm ready to bless God and His creation directly , but ... I must kill one noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others ... . 
Let us drink to life , dear brother . 
What can be more precious than life ? 
Nothing ! 
To life , and to one queen of queens ! '' 
`` Let 's drink to life and to your queen , too , if you like . '' 
They drank a glass each . 
Although Mitya was excited and expansive , yet he was melancholy , too . 
It was as though some heavy , overwhelming anxiety were weighing upon him . 
`` Misha ... here 's your Misha come ! 
Misha , come here , my boy , drink this glass to Phoebus the golden-haired , of to-morrow morn ... '' `` What are you giving it him for ? '' 
cried Pyotr Ilyitch , irritably . 
`` Yes , yes , yes , let me ! 
I want to ! '' 
`` E - ech ! '' 
Misha emptied the glass , bowed , and ran out . 
`` He 'll remember it afterwards , '' Mitya remarked . 
`` Woman , I love woman ! 
What is woman ? 
The queen of creation ! 
My heart is sad , my heart is sad , Pyotr Ilyitch . 
Do you remember Hamlet ? ' 
I am very sorry , good Horatio ! 
Alas , poor Yorick ! ' 
Perhaps that 's me , Yorick ? 
Yes , I 'm Yorick now , and a skull afterwards . '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch listened in silence . 
Mitya , too , was silent for a while . 
`` What dog 's that you 've got here ? '' 
he asked the shopman , casually , noticing a pretty little lap-dog with dark eyes , sitting in the corner . 
`` It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna , the mistress , '' answered the clerk . 
`` She brought it and forgot it here . 
It must be taken back to her . '' 
`` I saw one like it ... in the regiment ... '' murmured Mitya dreamily , `` only that one had its hind leg broken ... . 
By the way , Pyotr Ilyitch , I wanted to ask you : have you ever stolen anything in your life ? '' 
`` What a question ! '' 
`` Oh , I did n't mean anything . 
From somebody 's pocket , you know . 
I do n't mean government money , everyone steals that , and no doubt you do , too ... '' `` You go to the devil . '' 
`` I 'm talking of other people 's money . 
Stealing straight out of a pocket ? 
Out of a purse , eh ? '' 
`` I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old . 
I took it off the table on the sly , and held it tight in my hand . '' 
`` Well , and what happened ? '' 
`` Oh , nothing . 
I kept it three days , then I felt ashamed , confessed , and gave it back . '' 
`` And what then ? '' 
`` Naturally I was whipped . 
But why do you ask ? 
Have you stolen something ? '' 
`` I have , '' said Mitya , winking slyly . 
`` What have you stolen ? '' 
inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously . 
`` I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old , and gave it back three days after . '' 
As he said this , Mitya suddenly got up . 
`` Dmitri Fyodorovitch , wo n't you come now ? '' 
called Andrey from the door of the shop . 
`` Are you ready ? 
We 'll come ! '' 
Mitya started . 
`` A few more last words and - Andrey , a glass of vodka at starting . 
Give him some brandy as well ! 
That box '' -LRB- the one with the pistols -RRB- `` put under my seat . 
Good-bye , Pyotr Ilyitch , do n't remember evil against me . '' 
`` But you 're coming back to-morrow ? '' 
`` Will you settle the little bill now ? '' 
cried the clerk , springing forward . 
`` Oh yes , the bill . 
Of course . '' 
He pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again , picked out three hundred roubles , threw them on the counter , and ran hurriedly out of the shop . 
Everyone followed him out , bowing and wishing him good luck . 
Andrey , coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed , jumped up on the box . 
But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw Fenya before him . 
She ran up panting , clasped her hands before him with a cry , and plumped down at his feet . 
`` Dmitri Fyodorovitch , dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch , do n't harm my mistress . 
And it was I told you all about it ... . 
And do n't murder him , he came first , he 's hers ! 
He 'll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now . 
That 's why he 's come back from Siberia . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch , dear , do n't take a fellow creature 's life ! '' 
`` Tut-tut-tut ! 
That 's it , is it ? 
So you 're off there to make trouble ! '' 
muttered Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` Now , it 's all clear , as clear as daylight . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch , give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave like a man , '' he shouted aloud to Mitya . 
`` Do you hear , Dmitri ? '' 
`` The pistols ? 
Wait a bit , brother , I 'll throw them into the pool on the road , '' answered Mitya . 
`` Fenya , get up , do n't kneel to me . 
Mitya wo n't hurt anyone , the silly fool wo n't hurt anyone again . 
But I say , Fenya , '' he shouted , after having taken his seat . 
`` I hurt you just now , so forgive me and have pity on me , forgive a scoundrel ... . 
But it does n't matter if you do n't . 
It 's all the same now . 
Now then , Andrey , look alive , fly along full speed ! '' 
Andrey whipped up the horses , and the bells began ringing . 
`` Good-bye , Pyotr Ilyitch ! 
My last tear is for you ! 
... '' `` He 's not drunk , but he keeps babbling like a lunatic , '' Pyotr Ilyitch thought as he watched him go . 
He had half a mind to stay and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions , knowing that they would deceive and defraud Mitya . 
But , suddenly feeling vexed with himself , he turned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards . 
`` He 's a fool , though he 's a good fellow , '' he muttered as he went . 
`` I 've heard of that officer , Grushenka 's former flame . 
Well , if he has turned up ... . 
Ech , those pistols ! 
Damn it all ! 
I 'm not his nurse ! 
Let them do what they like ! 
Besides , it 'll all come to nothing . 
They 're a set of brawlers , that 's all . 
They 'll drink and fight , fight and make friends again . 
They are not men who do anything real . 
What does he mean by ` I 'm stepping aside , I 'm punishing myself ' ? 
It 'll come to nothing ! 
He 's shouted such phrases a thousand times , drunk , in the taverns . 
But now he 's not drunk . 
` Drunk in spirit ' - they 're fond of fine phrases , the villains . 
Am I his nurse ? 
He must have been fighting , his face was all over blood . 
With whom ? 
I shall find out at the Metropolis . 
And his handkerchief was soaked in blood ... . 
It 's still lying on my floor ... . 
Hang it ! '' 
He reached the tavern in a bad humour and at once made up a game . 
The game cheered him . 
He played a second game , and suddenly began telling one of his partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in for some cash again - something like three thousand roubles , and had gone to Mokroe again to spend it with Grushenka ... . 
This news roused singular interest in his listeners . 
They all spoke of it , not laughing , but with a strange gravity . 
They left off playing . 
`` Three thousand ? 
But where can he have got three thousand ? '' 
Questions were asked . 
The story of Madame Hohlakov 's present was received with scepticism . 
`` Has n't he robbed his old father ? 
- that 's the question . '' 
`` Three thousand ! 
There 's something odd about it . '' 
`` He boasted aloud that he would kill his father ; we all heard him , here . 
And it was three thousand he talked about ... '' Pyotr Ilyitch listened . 
All at once he became short and dry in his answers . 
He said not a word about the blood on Mitya 's face and hands , though he had meant to speak of it at first . 
They began a third game , and by degrees the talk about Mitya died away . 
But by the end of the third game , Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire for billiards ; he laid down the cue , and without having supper as he had intended , he walked out of the tavern . 
When he reached the market-place he stood still in perplexity , wondering at himself . 
He realised that what he wanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's and find out if anything had happened there . 
`` On account of some stupid nonsense as it 's sure to turn out - am I going to wake up the household and make a scandal ? 
Fooh ! 
damn it , is it my business to look after them ? '' 
In a very bad humour he went straight home , and suddenly remembered Fenya . 
`` Damn it all ! 
I ought to have questioned her just now , '' he thought with vexation , `` I should have heard everything . '' 
And the desire to speak to her , and so find out , became so pressing and importunate that when he was halfway home he turned abruptly and went towards the house where Grushenka lodged . 
Going up to the gate he knocked . 
The sound of the knock in the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed . 
And no one answered him ; everyone in the house was asleep . 
`` And I shall be making a fuss ! '' 
he thought , with a feeling of positive discomfort . 
But instead of going away altogether , he fell to knocking again with all his might , filling the street with clamour . 
`` Not coming ? 
Well , I will knock them up , I will ! '' 
he muttered at each knock , fuming at himself , but at the same time he redoubled his knocks on the gate . 
`` I Am Coming , Too ! '' 
BUT Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road . 
It was a little more than twenty versts to Mokroe , but Andrey 's three horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter . 
The swift motion revived Mitya . 
The air was fresh and cool , there were big stars shining in the sky . 
It was the very night , and perhaps the very hour , in which Alyosha fell on the earth , and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever . 
All was confusion , confusion in Mitya 's soul , but although many things were goading his heart , at that moment his whole being was yearning for her , his queen , to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time . 
One thing I can say for certain ; his heart did not waver for one instant . 
I shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous lover felt not the slightest jealousy of this new rival , who seemed to have sprung out of the earth . 
If any other had appeared on the scene , he would have been jealous at once , and would-perhaps have stained his fierce hands with blood again .
