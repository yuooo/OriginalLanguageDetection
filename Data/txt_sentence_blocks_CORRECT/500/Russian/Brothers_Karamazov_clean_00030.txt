`` Oh , undoubtedly , '' replied the prosecutor . 
His tone was somewhat cold , compared with Nikolay Parfenovitch 's impulsiveness . 
I will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch , who had but lately arrived among us , had from the first felt marked respect for Ippolit Kirillovitch , our prosecutor , and had become almost his bosom friend . 
He was almost the only person who put implicit faith in Ippolit Kirillovitch 's extraordinary talents as a psychologist and orator and in the justice of his grievance . 
He had heard of him in Petersburg . 
On the other hand , young Nikolay Parfenovitch was the only person in the whole world whom our `` unappreciated '' prosecutor genuinely liked . 
On their way to Mokroe they had time to come to an understanding about the present case . 
And now as they sat at the table , the sharp-witted junior caught and interpreted every indication on his senior colleague 's face - half a word , a glance , or a wink . 
`` Gentlemen , only let me tell my own story and do n't interrupt me with trivial questions and I 'll tell you everything in a moment , '' said Mitya excitedly . 
`` Excellent ! 
Thank you . 
But before we proceed to listen to your communication , will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact of great interest to us ? 
I mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday at about five o'clock on the security of your pistols , from your friend , Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin . '' 
`` I pledged them , gentlemen . 
I pledged them for ten roubles . 
What more ? 
That 's all about it . 
As soon as I got back to town I pledged them . '' 
`` You got back to town ? 
Then you had been out of town ? '' 
`` Yes , I went a journey of forty versts into the country . 
Did n't you know ? '' 
The prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances . 
`` Well , how would it be if you began your story with a systematic description of all you did yesterday , from the morning onwards ? 
Allow us , for instance , to inquire why you were absent from the town , and just when you left and when you came back - all those facts . '' 
`` You should have asked me like that from the beginning , '' cried Mitya , laughing aloud , `` and , if you like , we wo n't begin from yesterday , but from the morning of the day before ; then you 'll understand how , why , and where I went . 
I went the day before yesterday , gentlemen , to a merchant of the town , called Samsonov , to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe security . 
It was a pressing matter , gentlemen , it was a sudden necessity . '' 
`` Allow me to interrupt you , '' the prosecutor put in politely . 
`` Why were you in such pressing need for just that sum , three thousand ? '' 
`` Oh , gentlemen , you need n't go into details , how , when and why , and why just so much money , and not so much , and all that rigmarole . 
Why , it 'll run to three volumes , and then you 'll want an epilogue ! '' 
Mitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient familiarity of a man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full of the best intentions . 
`` Gentlemen ! '' 
- he corrected himself hurriedly - `` do n't be vexed with me for my restiveness , I beg you again . 
Believe me once more , I feel the greatest respect for you and understand the true position of affairs . 
Do n't think I 'm drunk . 
I 'm quite sober now . 
And , besides , being drunk would be no hindrance . 
It 's with me , you know , like the saying : ` When he is sober , he is a fool ; when he is drunk , he is a wise man . ' 
Ha ha ! 
But I see , gentlemen , it 's not the proper thing to make jokes to you , till we 've had our explanation , I mean . 
And I 've my own dignity to keep up , too . 
I quite understand the difference for the moment . 
I am , after all , in the position of a criminal , and so , far from being on equal terms with you . 
And it 's your business to watch me . 
I ca n't expect you to pat me on the head for what I did to Grigory , for one ca n't break old men 's heads with impunity . 
I suppose you 'll put me away for him for six months , or a year perhaps , in a house of correction . 
I do n't know what the punishment is - but it will be without loss of the rights of my rank , without loss of my rank , wo n't it ? 
So you see , gentlemen , I understand the distinction between us ... . 
But you must see that you could puzzle God Himself with such questions . 
` How did you step ? 
Where did you step ? 
When did you step ? 
And on what did you step ? ' 
I shall get mixed up , if you go on like this , and you will put it all down against me . 
And what will that lead to ? 
To nothing ! 
And even if it 's nonsense I 'm talking now , let me finish , and you , gentlemen , being men of honour and refinement , will forgive me ! 
I 'll finish by asking you , gentlemen , to drop that conventional method of questioning . 
I mean , beginning from some miserable trifle , how I got up , what I had for breakfast , how I spat , and where I spat , and so distracting the attention of the criminal , suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question , ` Whom did you murder ? 
Whom did you rob ? ' 
Ha-ha ! 
That 's your regulation method , that 's where all your cunning comes in . 
You can put peasants off their guard like that , but not me . 
I know the tricks . 
I 've been in the service , too . 
Ha ha ha ! 
You 're not angry , gentlemen ? 
You forgive my impertinence ? '' 
he cried , looking at them with a good-nature that was almost surprising . 
`` It 's only Mitya Karamazov , you know , so you can overlook it . 
It would be inexcusable in a sensible man ; but you can forgive it in Mitya . 
Ha ha ! '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch listened , and laughed too . 
Though the prosecutor did not laugh , he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya , as though anxious not to miss the least syllable , the slightest movement , the smallest twitch of any feature of his face . 
`` That 's how we have treated you from the beginning , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , still laughing . 
`` We have n't tried to put you out by asking how you got up in the morning and what you had for breakfast . 
We began , indeed , with questions of the greatest importance . '' 
`` I understand . 
I saw it and appreciated it , and I appreciate still more your present kindness to me , an unprecedented kindness , worthy of your noble hearts . 
We three here are gentlemen and let everything be on the footing of mutual confidence between educated , well-bred people , who have the common bond of noble birth and honour . 
In any case , allow me to look upon you as my best friends at this moment of my life , at this moment when my honour is assailed . 
That 's no offence to you , gentlemen , is it ? '' 
On the contrary . 
You 've expressed all that so well , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified approbation . 
`` And enough of those trivial questions , gentlemen , all those tricky questions ! 
cried Mitya enthusiastically . 
`` Or there 's simply no knowing where we shall get to ! 
Is there ? '' 
`` I will follow your sensible advice entirely , '' the prosecutor interposed , addressing Mitya . 
`` I do n't withdraw my question , however . 
It is now vitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that sum , I mean precisely three thousand . '' 
`` Why I needed it ? 
... Oh , for one thing and another ... . 
Well , it was to pay a debt . '' 
`` A debt to whom ? '' 
`` That I absolutely refuse to answer , gentlemen . 
Not because I could n't , or because I should n't dare , or because it would be damaging , for it 's all a paltry matter and absolutely trifling , but - I wo n't , because it 's a matter of principle : that 's my private life , and I wo n't allow any intrusion into my private life . 
That 's my principle . 
Your question has no bearing on the case , and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair . 
I wanted to pay a debt . 
I wanted to pay a debt of honour but to whom I wo n't say . '' 
`` Allow me to make a note of that , '' said the prosecutor . 
`` By all means . 
Write down that I wo n't say , that I wo n't . 
Write that I should think it dishonourable to say . 
Ech ! 
you can write it ; you 've nothing else to do with your time . '' 
`` Allow me to caution you , sir , and to remind you once more , if you are unaware of it , '' the prosecutor began , with a peculiar and stern impressiveness , `` that you have a perfect right not to answer the questions put to you now , and we on our side have no right to extort an answer from you , if you decline to give it for one reason or another . 
That is entirely a matter for your personal decision . 
But it is our duty , on the other hand , in such cases as the present , to explain and set before you the degree of injury you will be doing yourself by refusing to give this or that piece of evidence . 
After which I will beg you to continue . '' 
`` Gentlemen , I 'm not angry ... I. . . 
`` Mitya muttered in a rather disconcerted tone . 
`` Well , gentlemen , you see , that Samsonov to whom I went then ... '' We will , of course , not reproduce his account of what is known to the reader already . 
Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest detail . 
At the same time he was in a hurry to get it over . 
But as he gave his evidence it was written down , and therefore they had continually to pull him up . 
Mitya disliked this , but submitted ; got angry , though still good-humouredly . 
He did , it is true , exclaim , from time to time , `` Gentlemen , that 's enough to make an angel out of patience ! '' 
Or , `` Gentlemen , it 's no good your irritating me . '' 
But even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his genially expansive mood . 
So he told them how Samsonov had made a fool of him two days before . 
-LRB- He had completely realised by now that he had been fooled . -RRB- 
The sale of his watch for six roubles to obtain money for the journey was something new to the lawyers . 
They were at once greatly interested , and even , to Mitya 's intense indignation , thought it necessary to write the fact down as a secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he had hardly a farthing in his pocket at the time . 
Little by little Mitya began to grow surly . 
Then , after describing his journey to see Lyagavy , the night spent in the stifling hut , and so on , he came to his return to the town . 
Here he began , without being particularly urged , to give a minute account of the agonies of jealousy he endured on Grushenka 's account . 
He was heard with silent attention . 
They inquired particularly into the circumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya Kondratyevna 's house at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's garden to keep watch on Grushenka , and of Smerdyakov 's bringing him information . 
They laid particular stress on this , and noted it down . 
Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length , and though inwardly ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings to `` public ignominy , '' so to speak , he evidently overcame his shame in order to tell the truth . 
The frigid severity with which the investigating lawyer , and still more the prosecutor , stared intently at him as he told his story , disconcerted him at last considerably . 
`` That boy , Nikolay Parfenovitch , to whom I was talking nonsense about women only a few days ago , and that sickly prosecutor are not worth my telling this to , '' he reflected mournfully . 
`` It 's ignominious . 
` Be patient , humble , hold thy peace . ' '' 
He wound up his reflections with that line . 
But he pulled himself together to go on again . 
When he came to telling of his visit to Madame Hohlakov , he regained his spirits and even wished to tell a little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case . 
But the investigating lawyer stopped him , and civilly suggested that he should pass on to `` more essential matters . '' 
At last , when he described his despair and told them how , when he left Madame Hohlakov 's , he thought that he 'd `` get three thousand if he had to murder someone to do it , '' they stopped him again and noted down that he had `` meant to murder someone . '' 
Mitya let them write it without protest . 
At last he reached the point in his story when he learned that Grushenka had deceived him and had returned from Samsonov 's as soon as he left her there , though she had said that she would stay there till midnight . 
`` If I did n't kill Fenya then , gentlemen , it was only because I had n't time , '' broke from him suddenly at that point in his story . 
That , too , was carefully written down . 
Mitya waited gloomily , and was beginning to tell how he ran into his father 's garden when the investigating lawyer suddenly stopped him , and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him he brought out the brass pestle . 
`` Do you recognise this object ? '' 
he asked , showing it to Mitya . 
`` Oh , yes , '' he laughed gloomily . 
`` Of course , I recognise it . 
Let me have a look at it ... . 
Damn it , never mind ! '' 
`` You have forgotten to mention it , '' observed the investigating lawyer . 
`` Hang it all , I should n't have concealed it from you . 
Do you suppose I could have managed without it ? 
It simply escaped my memory . '' 
`` Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it . '' 
`` Certainly I will be so good , gentlemen . '' 
And Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran . 
`` But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon ? '' 
`` What object ? 
No object . 
I just picked it up and ran off . '' 
`` What for , if you had no object ? '' 
Mitya 's wrath flared up . 
He looked intently at `` the boy '' and smiled gloomily and malignantly . 
He was feeling more and more ashamed at having told `` such people '' the story of his jealousy so sincerely and spontaneously . 
`` Bother the pestle ! '' 
broke from him suddenly . 
`` But still - '' `` Oh , to keep off dogs ... Oh , because it was dark ... . 
In case anything turned up . '' 
`` But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you went out , since you 're afraid of the dark ? '' 
`` Ugh ! 
damn it all , gentlemen ! 
There 's positively no talking to you ! '' 
cried Mitya , exasperated beyond endurance , and turning to the secretary , crimson with anger , he said quickly , with a note of fury in his voice : `` Write down at once ... at once ... ` that I snatched up the pestle to go and kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the head with it ! ' 
Well , now are you satisfied , gentlemen ? 
Are your minds relieved ? '' 
he said , glaring defiantly at the lawyers . 
`` We quite understand that you made that statement just now through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you , which you consider trivial , though they are , in fact , essential , '' the prosecutor remarked drily in reply . 
`` Well , upon my word , gentlemen ! 
Yes , I took the pestle ... . 
What does one pick things up for at such moments ? 
I do n't know what for . 
I snatched it up and ran - that 's all . 
For to me , gentlemen , passons , or I declare I wo n't tell you any more . '' 
He sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand . 
He sat sideways to them and gazed at the wall , struggling against a feeling of nausea . 
He had , in fact , an awful inclination to get up and declare that he would n't say another word , `` not if you hang me for it . '' 
`` You see , gentlemen , '' he said at last , with difficulty controlling himself , `` you see . 
I listen to you and am haunted by a dream ... . 
It 's a dream I have sometimes , you know ... . 
I often dream it - it 's always the same ... that someone is hunting me , someone I 'm awfully afraid of ... that he 's hunting me in the dark , in the night ... tracking me , and I hide somewhere from him , behind a door or cupboard , hide in a degrading way , and the worst of it is , he always knows where I am , but he pretends not to know where I am on purpose , to prolong my agony , to enjoy my terror ... . 
That 's just what you 're doing now . 
It 's just like that ! '' 
`` Is that the sort of thing you dream about ? '' 
inquired the prosecutor . 
`` Yes , it is . 
Do n't you want to write it down ? '' 
said Mitya , with a distorted smile . 
`` No ; no need to write it down . 
But still you do have curious dreams . '' 
`` It 's not a question of dreams now , gentlemen - this is realism , this is real life ! 
I 'm a wolf and you 're the hunters . 
Well , hunt him down ! '' 
`` You are wrong to make such comparisons . '' 
began Nikolay Parfenovitch , with extraordinary softness . 
`` No , I 'm not wrong , at all ! '' 
Mitya flared up again , though his outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart . 
He grew more good humoured at every word . 
`` You may not trust a criminal or a man on trial tortured by your questions , but an honourable man , the honourable impulses of the heart -LRB- I say that boldly ! -RRB- 
- no ! 
That you must believe you have no right indeed ... but - Be silent , heart , Be patient , humble , hold thy peace . 
Well , shall I go on ? '' 
he broke off gloomily . 
`` If you 'll be so kind , '' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
The Third Ordeal THOUGH Mitya spoke sullenly , it was evident that he was trying more than ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story . 
He told them how he had leapt over the fence into his father 's garden ; how he had gone up to the window ; told them all that had passed under the window . 
Clearly , precisely , distinctly , he described the feelings that troubled him during those moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether Grushenka was with his father or not . 
But , strange to say , both the lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve , looked coldly at him , asked few questions . 
Mitya could gather nothing from their faces . 
`` They 're angry and offended , '' he thought . 
`` Well , bother them ! '' 
When he described how he made up his mind at last to make the `` signal '' to his father that Grushenka had come , so that he should open the window , the lawyers paid no attention to the word `` signal , '' as though they entirely failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection : so much so , that Mitya noticed it . 
Coming at last to the moment when , seeing his father peering out of the window , his hatred flared up and he pulled the pestle out of his pocket , he suddenly , as though of design , stopped short . 
He sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon him . 
`` Well ? '' 
said the investigating lawyer . 
`` You pulled out the weapon and ... and what happened then ? 
`` Then ? 
Why , then I murdered him ... hit him on the head and cracked his skull ... . 
I suppose that 's your story . 
That 's it ! '' 
His eyes suddenly flashed . 
All his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up with extraordinary violence in his soul . 
`` Our story ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
Mitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent . 
`` My story , gentlemen ? 
Well , was like this , '' he began softly . 
`` Whether it was like this , '' he began softly . 
`` Whether it was someone 's tears , or my mother prayed to God , or a good angel kissed me at that instant , I do n't know . 
But the devil was conquered . 
I rushed from the window and ran to the fence . 
My father was alarmed and , for the first time , he saw me then , cried out , and sprang back from the window . 
I remember that very well . 
I ran across the garden to the fence ... and there Grigory caught me , when I was sitting on the fence . '' 
At that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners . 
They seemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention . 
A sort of paroxysm of indignation seized on Mitya 's soul . 
`` Why , you 're laughing at me at this moment , gentlemen ! '' 
he broke off suddenly . 
`` What makes you think that ? '' 
observed Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` You do n't believe one word - that 's why ! 
I understand , of course , that I have come to the vital point . 
The old man 's lying there now with his skull broken , while I - after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him , and how I snatched up the pestle - I suddenly run away from the window . 
A romance ! 
Poetry ! 
As though one could believe a fellow on his word . 
Ha ha ! 
You are scoffers , gentlemen ! '' 
And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked . 
`` And did you notice , '' asked the prosecutor suddenly , as though not observing Mitya 's excitement , `` did you notice when you ran away from the window , whether the door into the garden was open ? '' 
`` No , it was not open . '' 
`` It was not ? '' 
`` It was shut . 
And who could open it ? 
Bah ! 
the door . 
Wait a bit ! '' 
he seemed suddenly to bethink himself , and almost with a start : `` Why , did you find the door open ? '' 
`` Yes , it was open . '' 
`` Why , who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves ? '' 
cried Mitya , greatly astonished . 
`` The door stood open , and your father 's murderer undoubtedly went in at that door , and , having accomplished the crime , went out again by the same door , '' the prosecutor pronounced deliberately , as though chiselling out each word separately . 
`` That is perfectly clear . 
The murder was committed in the room and not through the window ; that is absolutely certain from the examination that has been made , from the position of the body and everything . 
There can be no doubt of that circumstance . '' 
Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded . 
`` But that 's utterly impossible ! '' 
he cried , completely at a loss . 
`` I. . . 
I did n't go in ... . 
I tell you positively , definitely , the door was shut the whole time I was in the garden , and when I ran out of the garden . 
I only stood at the window and saw him through the window . 
That 's all , that 's all ... . 
I remember to the last minute . 
And if I did n't remember , it would be just the same . 
I know it , for no one knew the signals except Smerdyakov , and me , and the dead man . 
And he would n't have opened the door to anyone in the world without the signals . '' 
`` Signals ? 
What signals ? '' 
asked the prosecutor , with greedy , almost hysterical , curiosity . 
He instantly lost all trace of his reserve and dignity . 
He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity . 
He scented an important fact of which he had known nothing , and was already filled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it . 
`` So you did n't know ! '' 
Mitya winked at him with a malicious and mocking smile . 
`` What if I wo n't tell you ? 
From whom could you find out ? 
No one knew about the signals except my father , Smerdyakov , and me : that was all . 
Heaven knew , too , but it wo n't tell you . 
But it 's an interesting fact . 
There 's no knowing what you might build on it . 
Ha ha ! 
Take comfort , gentlemen , I 'll reveal it . 
You 've some foolish idea in your hearts . 
You do n't know the man you have to deal with ! 
You have to do with a prisoner who gives evidence against himself , to his own damage ! 
Yes , for I 'm a man of honour and you - are not . '' 
The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur . 
He was trembling with impatience to hear the new fact . 
Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them everything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov . 
He told them exactly what every tap on the window meant , tapped the signals on the table , and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposed he , Mitya , had tapped the signal `` Grushenka has come , '' when he tapped to his father , he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal , that `` Grushenka had come . '' 
`` So now you can build up your tower , '' Mitya broke off , and again turned away from them contemptuously . 
`` So no one knew of the signals but your dead father , you , and the valet Smerdyakov ? 
And no one else ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more . 
`` Yes . 
The valet Smerdyakov , and Heaven . 
Write down about Heaven . 
That may be of use . 
Besides , you will need God yourselves . '' 
And they had already of course , begun writing it down . 
But while they wrote , the prosecutor said suddenly , as though pitching on a new idea : `` But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny all responsibility for the death of your father , was it not he , perhaps , who knocked the signal agreed upon , induced your father to open to him , and then ... committed the crime ? '' 
Mitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred . 
His silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink . 
`` You 've caught the fox again , '' commented Mitya at last ; `` you 've got the beast by the tail . 
Ha ha ! 
I see through you , Mr. Prosecutor . 
You thought , of course , that I should jump at that , catch at your prompting , and shout with all my might , ` Aie ! 
it 's Smerdyakov ; he 's the murderer . ' 
Confess that 's what you thought . 
Confess , and I 'll go on . '' 
But the prosecutor did not confess . 
He held his tongue and waited . 
`` You 're mistaken . 
I 'm not going to shout , ` It 's Smerdyakov , ' '' said Mitya . 
`` And you do n't even suspect him ? '' 
`` Why , do you suspect him ? '' 
`` He is suspected , too . '' 
Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor . 
`` Joking apart , '' he brought out gloomily . 
`` Listen . 
From the very beginning , almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain , I 've had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind . 
I 've been sitting here , shouting that I 'm innocent and thinking all the time ` Smerdyakov ! ' 
I ca n't get Smerdyakov out of my head . 
In fact , I , too , thought of Smerdyakov just now ; but only for a second . 
Almost at once I thought , ` No , it 's not Smerdyakov . ' 
It 's not his doing , gentlemen . '' 
`` In that case is there anybody else you suspect ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously . 
`` I do n't know anyone it could be , whether it 's the hand of Heaven or of Satan , but ... not Smerdyakov , '' Mitya jerked out with decision . 
`` But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it 's not he ? '' 
`` From my conviction - my impression . 
Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward . 
He 's not a coward , he 's the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs . 
He has the heart of a chicken . 
When he talked to me , he was always trembling for fear I should kill him , though I never raised my hand against him . 
He fell at my feet and blubbered ; he has kissed these very boots , literally , beseeching me ` not to frighten him . ' 
Do you hear ? 
` Not to frighten him . ' 
What a thing to say ! 
Why , I offered him money . 
He 's a puling chicken - sickly , epileptic , weak-minded - a child of eight could thrash him . 
He has no character worth talking about . 
It 's not Smerdyakov , gentlemen . 
He does n't care for money ; he would n't take my presents . 
Besides , what motive had he for murdering the old man ? 
Why , he 's very likely his son , you know - his natural son . 
Do you know that ? '' 
`` We have heard that legend . 
But you are your father 's son , too , you know ; yet you yourself told everyone you meant to murder him . '' 
`` That 's a thrust ! 
And a nasty , mean one , too ! 
I 'm not afraid ! 
Oh , gentlemen , is n't it too base of you to say that to my face ? 
It 's base , because I told you that myself . 
I not only wanted to murder him , but I might have done it . 
And , what 's more , I went out of my way to tell you of my own accord that I nearly murdered him . 
But , you see , I did n't murder him ; you see , my guardian angel saved me - that 's what you 've not taken into account . 
And that 's why it 's so base of you . 
For I did n't kill him , I did n't kill him ! 
Do you hear , I did not kill him . '' 
He was almost choking . 
He had not been so moved before during the whole interrogation . 
`` And what has he told you , gentlemen - Smerdyakov , I mean ? '' 
he added suddenly , after a pause . 
`` May I ask that question ? '' 
`` You may ask any question , '' the prosecutor replied with frigid severity , `` any question relating to the facts of the case , and we are , I repeat , bound to answer every inquiry you make . 
We found the servant Smerdyakov , concerning whom you inquire , lying unconscious in his bed , in an epileptic fit of extreme severity , that had recurred , possibly , ten times . 
The doctor who was with us told us , after seeing him , that he may possibly not outlive the night . '' 
`` Well , if that 's so , the devil must have killed him , '' broke suddenly from Mitya , as though until that moment had been asking himself : `` Was it Smerdyakov or not ? '' 
`` We will come back to this later , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch decided . 
`` Now would n't you like to continue your statement ? '' 
Mitya asked for a rest . 
His request was courteously granted . 
After resting , he went on with his story . 
But he was evidently depressed . 
He was exhausted , mortified , and morally shaken . 
To make things worse the prosecutor exasperated him , as though intentionally , by vexatious interruptions about `` trifling points . '' 
Scarcely had Mitya described how , sitting on the wall , he had struck Grigory on the head with the pestle , while the old man had hold of his left leg , and how he then jumped down to look at him , when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him to describe exactly how he was sitting on the wall . 
Mitya was surprised . 
`` Oh , I was sitting like this , astride , one leg on one side of the wall and one on the other . '' 
`` And the pestle ? '' 
`` The pestle was in my hand . '' 
`` Not in your pocket ? 
Do you remember that precisely ? 
Was it a violent blow you gave him ? '' 
`` It must have been a violent one . 
But why do you ask ? '' 
`` Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and showing us just how you moved your arm , and in what direction ? '' 
`` You 're making fun of me , are n't you ? '' 
asked Mitya , looking haughtily at the speaker ; but the latter did not flinch . 
Mitya turned abruptly , sat astride on his chair , and swung his arm . 
`` This was how I struck him ! 
That 's how I knocked him down ! 
What more do you want ? '' 
`` Thank you . 
May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down , with what object , and what you had in view ? '' 
`` Oh , hang it ! 
... I jumped down to look at the man I 'd hurt ... I do n't know what for ! '' 
`` Though you were so excited and were running away ? '' 
`` Yes , though I was excited and running away . '' 
`` You wanted to help him ? '' 
`` Help ! 
... Yes , perhaps I did want to help him ... . 
I do n't remember . '' 
`` You do n't remember ? 
Then you did n't quite know what you were doing ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
I remember everything - every detail . 
I jumped down to look at him , and wiped his face with my handkerchief . '' 
`` We have seen your handkerchief . 
Did you hope to restore him to consciousness ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether I hoped it . 
I simply wanted to make sure whether he was alive or not . '' 
`` Ah ! 
You wanted to be sure ? 
Well , what then ? '' 
`` I 'm not a doctor . 
I could n't decide . 
I ran away thinking I 'd killed him . 
And now he 's recovered . '' 
`` Excellent , '' commented the prosecutor . 
`` Thank you . 
That 's all I wanted . 
Kindly proceed . '' 
Alas ! 
it never entered Mitya 's head to tell them , though he remembered it , that he had jumped back from pity , and standing over the prostrate figure had even uttered some words of regret : `` You 've come to grief , old man - there 's no help for it . 
Well , there you must lie . '' 
The prosecutor could only draw one conclusion : that the man had jumped back `` at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of ascertaining whether the only witness of his crime were dead ; that he must therefore have been a man of great strength , coolness , decision , and foresight even at such a moment , '' ... and so on . 
The prosecutor was satisfied : `` I 've provoked the nervous fellow by ` trifles ' and he has said more than he meant With painful effort Mitya went on . 
But this time he was pulled up immediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` How came you to run to the servant , Fedosya Markovna , with your hands so covered with blood , and , as it appears , your face , too ? '' 
`` Why , I did n't notice the blood at all at the time , '' answered Mitya . 
`` That 's quite likely . 
It does happen sometimes . '' 
The prosecutor exchanged glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` I simply did n't notice . 
You 're quite right there , prosecutor , '' Mitya assented suddenly . 
Next came the account of Mitya 's sudden determination to `` step aside '' and make way for their happiness . 
But he could not make up his mind to open his heart to them as before , and tell them about `` the queen of his soul . '' 
He disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons `` who were fastening on him like bugs . '' 
And so in response to their reiterated questions he answered briefly and abruptly : `` Well , I made up my mind to kill myself . 
What had I left to live for ? 
That question stared me in the face . 
Her first rightful lover had come back , the man who wronged her but who 'd hurried back to offer his love , after five years , and atone for the wrong with marriage ... . 
So I knew it was all over for me ... . 
And behind me disgrace , and that blood - Grigory 's ... . 
What had I to live for ? 
So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged , to load them and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow . '' 
`` And a grand feast the night before ? '' 
`` Yes , a grand feast the night before . 
Damn it all , gentlemen ! 
Do make haste and finish it . 
I meant to shoot myself not far from here , beyond the village , and I 'd planned to do it at five o'clock in the morning . 
And I had a note in my pocket already . 
I wrote it at Perhotin 's when I loaded my pistols . 
Here 's the letter . 
Read it ! 
It 's not for you I tell it , '' he added contemptuously . 
He took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the table . 
The lawyers read it with curiosity , and , as is usual , added it to the papers connected with the case . 
`` And you did n't even think of washing your hands at Perhotin 's ? 
You were not afraid then of arousing suspicion ? '' 
`` What suspicion ? 
Suspicion or not , I should have galloped here just the same , and shot myself at five o'clock , and you would n't have been in time to do anything . 
If it had n't been for what 's happened to my father , you would have known nothing about it , and would n't have come here . 
Oh , it 's the devil 's doing . 
It was the devil murdered father , it was through the devil that you found it out so soon . 
How did you manage to get here so quick ? 
It 's marvellous , a dream ! '' 
`` Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him , you held in your hands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money ... a bundle of hundred-rouble notes , and that his servant-boy saw it too . '' 
`` That 's true , gentlemen . 
I remember it was so . '' 
`` Now , there 's one little point presents itself .
