said he . 
`` Here 's a fine warrior ! 
No ! 
Nonsense ! 
You must study . '' 
`` It 's not nonsense , Papa . 
Fedya Obolenski is younger than I , and he 's going too . 
Besides , all the same I ca n't study now when ... '' Petya stopped short , flushed till he perspired , but still got out the words , `` when our Fatherland is in danger . '' 
`` That 'll do , that 'll do -- nonsense ... '' `` But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything . '' 
`` Petya ! 
Be quiet , I tell you ! '' 
cried the count , with a glance at his wife , who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son . 
`` And I tell you -- Peter Kirilych here will also tell you ... '' `` Nonsense , I tell you . 
Your mother 's milk has hardly dried on your lips and you want to go into the army ! 
There , there , I tell you , '' and the count moved to go out of the room , taking the papers , probably to reread them in his study before having a nap . 
`` Well , Peter Kirilych , let 's go and have a smoke , '' he said . 
Pierre was agitated and undecided . 
Natasha 's unwontedly brilliant eyes , continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look , had reduced him to this condition . 
`` No , I think I 'll go home . '' 
`` Home ? 
Why , you meant to spend the evening with us ... . 
You do n't often come nowadays as it is , and this girl of mine , '' said the count good-naturedly , pointing to Natasha , `` only brightens up when you 're here . '' 
`` Yes , I had forgotten ... I really must go home ... business ... '' said Pierre hurriedly . 
`` Well , then , au revoir ! '' 
said the count , and went out of the room . 
`` Why are you going ? 
Why are you upset ? '' 
asked Natasha , and she looked challengingly into Pierre 's eyes . 
`` Because I love you ! '' 
was what he wanted to say , but he did not say it , and only blushed till the tears came , and lowered his eyes . 
`` Because it is better for me to come less often ... because ... No , simply I have business ... '' `` Why ? 
No , tell me ! '' 
Natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped . 
They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces . 
He tried to smile but could not : his smile expressed suffering , and he silently kissed her hand and went out . 
Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostovs ' any more . 
After the definite refusal he had received , Petya went to his room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly . 
When he came in to tea , silent , morose , and with tear-stained face , everybody pretended not to notice anything . 
Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow , and several of the Rostovs ' domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him . 
That morning Petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar to look like a grown-up man . 
He frowned before his looking glass , gesticulated , shrugged his shoulders , and finally , without saying a word to anyone , took his cap and left the house by the back door , trying to avoid notice . 
Petya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting -LRB- he imagined the Emperor to be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting -RRB- that he , Count Rostov , in spite of his youth wished to serve his country ; that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty , and that he was ready to ... While dressing , Petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman-in-waiting . 
It was on the very fact of being so young that Petya counted for success in reaching the Emperor -- he even thought how surprised everyone would be at his youthfulness -- and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man . 
But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the ever-increasing crowds moving toward the Kremlin , the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man . 
As he approached the Kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a menacing way . 
But within the Trinity Gateway he was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination he had to give in , and stop while carriages passed in , rumbling beneath the archway . 
Beside Petya stood a peasant woman , a footman , two tradesmen , and a discharged soldier . 
After standing some time in the gateway , Petya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass , and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows , but the woman just in front of him , who was the first against whom he directed his efforts , angrily shouted at him : `` What are you shoving for , young lordling ? 
Do n't you see we 're all standing still ? 
Then why push ? '' 
`` Anybody can shove , '' said the footman , and also began working his elbows to such effect that he pushed Petya into a very filthy corner of the gateway . 
Petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man 's . 
He felt that he no longer looked presentable , and feared that if he were now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be admitted to the Emperor . 
But it was impossible to smarten oneself up or move to another place , because of the crowd . 
One of the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostovs ' , and Petya thought of asking his help , but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to do . 
When the carriages had all passed in , the crowd , carrying Petya with it , streamed forward into the Kremlin Square which was already full of people . 
There were people not only in the square , but everywhere -- on the slopes and on the roofs . 
As soon as Petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole Kremlin . 
For a while the crowd was less dense , but suddenly all heads were bared , and everyone rushed forward in one direction . 
Petya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe , and everybody shouted , `` Hurrah ! 
hurrah ! 
hurrah ! '' 
Petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched , but could see nothing except the people about him . 
All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm . 
A tradesman 's wife standing beside Petya sobbed , and the tears ran down her cheeks . 
`` Father ! 
Angel ! 
Dear one ! '' 
she kept repeating , wiping away her tears with her fingers . 
`` Hurrah ! '' 
was heard on all sides . 
For a moment the crowd stood still , but then it made another rush forward . 
Quite beside himself , Petya , clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously , pushed forward , elbowing his way and shouting `` hurrah ! '' 
as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else , but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted `` hurrah ! '' 
`` So this is what the Emperor is ! '' 
thought Petya . 
`` No , I ca n't petition him myself -- that would be too bold . '' 
But in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward , and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it ; but just then the crowd swayed back -- the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession : the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption -- and Petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness . 
When he came to himself , a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock -- probably a church clerk and chanter -- was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other . 
`` You 've crushed the young gentleman ! '' 
said the clerk . 
`` What are you up to ? 
Gently ! 
... They 've crushed him , crushed him ! '' 
The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption . 
The crowd spread out again more evenly , and the clerk led Petya -- pale and breathless -- to the Tsar-cannon . 
Several people were sorry for Petya , and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him . 
Those who stood nearest him attended to him , unbuttoned his coat , seated him on the raised platform of the cannon , and reproached those others -LRB- whoever they might be -RRB- who had crushed him . 
`` One might easily get killed that way ! 
What do they mean by it ? 
Killing people ! 
Poor dear , he 's as white as a sheet ! '' 
-- various voices were heard saying . 
Petya soon came to himself , the color returned to his face , the pain had passed , and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who would be returning that way . 
Petya no longer thought of presenting his petition . 
If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy ! 
While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption - it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor 's arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the Turks -- the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared , selling kvas , gingerbread , and poppyseed sweets -LRB- of which Petya was particularly fond -RRB- , and ordinary conversation could again be heard . 
A tradesman 's wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost ; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear . 
The clerk who had rescued Petya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop . 
The clerk several times used the word `` plenary '' -LRB- of the service -RRB- , a word Petya did not understand . 
Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts . 
All these conversations , especially the joking with the girls , were such as might have had a particular charm for Petya at his age , but they did not interest him now . 
He sat on his elevation -- the pedestal of the cannon -- still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by his love for him . 
The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed , together with that of rapture , still further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion . 
Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment , to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks , and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing . 
Petya too would have run there , but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him . 
The firing was still proceeding when officers , generals , and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the cathedral , and after them others in a more leisurely manner : caps were again raised , and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again . 
At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors . 
`` Hurrah ! 
hurrah ! '' 
shouted the crowd again . 
`` Which is he ? 
Which ? '' 
asked Petya in a tearful voice , of those around him , but no one answered him , everybody was too excited ; and Petya , fixing on one of those four men , whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes , concentrated all his enthusiasm on him -- though it happened not to be the Emperor - frantically shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
and resolved that tomorrow , come what might , he would join the army . 
The crowd ran after the Emperor , followed him to the palace , and began to disperse . 
It was already late , and Petya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration , yet he did not go home but stood with that diminishing , but still considerable , crowd before the palace while the Emperor dined -- looking in at the palace windows , expecting he knew not what , and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table , glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows . 
While the Emperor was dining , Valuev , looking out of the window , said : `` The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again . '' 
The dinner was nearly over , and the Emperor , munching a biscuit , rose and went out onto the balcony . 
The people , with Petya among them , rushed toward the balcony . 
`` Angel ! 
Dear one ! 
Hurrah ! 
Father ! 
... '' cried the crowd , and Petya with it , and again the women and men of weaker mold , Petya among them , wept with joy . 
A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke off , fell on the balcony parapet , and then to the ground . 
A coachman in a jerkin , who stood nearest , sprang forward and snatched it up . 
Several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman . 
Seeing this the Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the balcony . 
Petya 's eyes grew bloodshot , and still more excited by the danger of being crushed , he rushed at the biscuits . 
He did not know why , but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsar 's hand and he felt that he must not give way . 
He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit ; the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on the ground -- she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach them . 
Petya pushed her hand away with his knee , seized a biscuit , and as if fearing to be too late , again shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
with a voice already hoarse . 
The Emperor went in , and after that the greater part of the crowd began to disperse . 
`` There ! 
I said if only we waited -- and so it was ! '' 
was being joyfully said by various people . 
Happy as Petya was , he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over . 
He did not go straight home from the Kremlin , but called on his friend Obolenski , who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment . 
On returning home Petya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away . 
And next day , Count Ilya Rostov -- though he had not yet quite yielded -- went to inquire how he could arrange for Petya to serve where there would be least danger . 
Two days later , on the fifteenth of July , an immense number of carriages were standing outside the Sloboda Palace . 
The great halls were full . 
In the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms , in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals . 
In the noblemen 's hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices . 
The chief magnates sat on high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor , but most of the gentry were strolling about the room . 
All these nobles , whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own houses , were in uniform -- some in that of Catherine 's day , others in that of Emperor Paul , others again in the new uniforms of Alexander 's time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility , and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities , both old and young . 
The old men , dim-eyed , toothless , bald , sallow , and bloated , or gaunt and wrinkled , were especially striking . 
For the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent , or , if they walked about and talked , attached themselves to someone younger . 
On all these faces , as on the faces of the crowd Petya had seen in the Square , there was a striking contradiction : the general expectation of a solemn event , and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston card party , Peter the cook , Zinaida Dmitrievna 's health , and so on . 
Pierre was there too , buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman 's uniform that had become too tight for him . 
He was agitated ; this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant-class -- les etats generaux -LRB- States-General -RRB- -- evoked in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul : thoughts of the Contrat social and the French Revolution . 
The words that had struck him in the Emperor 's appeal - that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his people -- strengthened this idea . 
And imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing near , he strolled about watching and listening to conversations , but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him . 
The Emperor 's manifesto was read , evoking enthusiasm , and then all moved about discussing it . 
Besides the ordinary topics of conversation , Pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the Emperor entered , when a ball should be given in the Emperor 's honor , whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces ... and so on ; but as soon as the war was touched on , or what the nobility had been convened for , the talk became undecided and indefinite . 
Then all preferred listening to speaking . 
A middle-aged man , handsome and virile , in the uniform of a retired naval officer , was speaking in one of the rooms , and a small crowd was pressing round him . 
Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened . 
Count Ilya Rostov , in a military uniform of Catherine 's time , was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd , with all of whom he was acquainted . 
He too approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval , as he always did , to what the speaker was saying . 
The retired naval man was speaking very boldly , as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him . 
Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group , listened , and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal , but of views quite different from his own . 
The naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous , musical , and aristocratic baritone voice , pleasantly swallowing his r 's and generally slurring his consonants : the voice of a man calling out to his servant , `` Heah ! 
Bwing me my pipe ! '' 
It was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority . 
`` What if the Smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the Empewah ? 
Ah we to take Smolensk as our patte ` n ? 
If the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit , it can show its loyalty to our sov ` weign the Empewah in other ways . 
Have we fo ` gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah ` seven ? 
All that did was to enwich the pwiests ' sons and thieves and wobbahs ... '' Count Ilya Rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval . 
`` And was our militia of any use to the Empia ? 
Not at all ! 
It only wuined our farming ! 
Bettah have another conscwiption ... o ' ou ' men will wetu 'n neithah soldiers no ' peasants , and we 'll get only depwavity fwom them . 
The nobility do n't gwudge theah lives -- evewy one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits , and the sov ` weign '' -LRB- that was the way he referred to the Emperor -RRB- `` need only say the word and we 'll all die fo ' him ! '' 
added the orator with animation . 
Count Rostov 's mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre , but Pierre wanted to speak himself . 
He pushed forward , feeling stirred , but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say . 
Scarcely had he opened his mouth when one of the senators , a man without a tooth in his head , with a shrewd though angry expression , standing near the first speaker , interrupted him . 
Evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument , he began in low but distinct tones : `` I imagine , sir , '' said he , mumbling with his toothless mouth , `` that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it 's best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia . 
We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us . 
But to judge what is best -- conscription or the militia -- we can leave to the supreme authority ... '' Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement . 
He hardened his heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility . 
Pierre stepped forward and interrupted him . 
He himself did not yet know what he would say , but he began to speak eagerly , occasionally lapsing into French or expressing himself in bookish Russian . 
`` Excuse me , your excellency , '' he began . 
-LRB- He was well acquainted with the senator , but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally . -RRB- 
`` Though I do n't agree with the gentleman ... '' -LRB- he hesitated : he wished to say , `` Mon tres honorable preopinant '' -- `` My very honorable opponent '' -RRB- `` with the gentleman ... whom I have not the honor of knowing , I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can assist our Fatherland ! 
I imagine , '' he went on , warming to his subject , `` that the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service , and chair a canon * we are ready to make of ourselves -- and not to obtain from us any co-co-counsel . '' 
* `` Food for cannon . '' 
Many persons withdrew from the circle , noticing the senator 's sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre 's remarks . 
Only Count Rostov was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer , the senator , and in general with whatever speech he had last heard . 
`` I think that before discussing these questions , '' Pierre continued , `` we should ask the Emperor -- most respectfully ask His Majesty -- to let us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our forces now are , and then ... '' But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from three sides . 
The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance , a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him , Stepan Stepanovich Adraksin . 
Adraksin was in uniform , and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a different man . 
With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face , Adraksin shouted at Pierre : `` In the first place , I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor about that , and secondly , if the Russian nobility had that right , the Emperor could not answer such a question . 
The troops are moved according to the enemy 's movements and the number of men increases and decreases ... '' Another voice , that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age , whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies ' and knew as a bad cardplayer , and who , also transformed by his uniform , came up to Pierre , interrupted Adraksin . 
`` Yes , and this is not a time for discussing , '' he continued , `` but for acting : there is war in Russia ! 
The enemy is advancing to destroy Russia , to desecrate the tombs of our fathers , to carry off our wives and children . '' 
The nobleman smote his breast . 
`` We will all arise , every one of us will go , for our father the Tsar ! '' 
he shouted , rolling his bloodshot eyes . 
Several approving voices were heard in the crowd . 
`` We are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith , the throne , and the Fatherland ! 
We must cease raving if we are sons of our Fatherland ! 
We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of Russia ! '' 
Pierre wished to reply , but could not get in a word . 
He felt that his words , apart from what meaning they conveyed , were less audible than the sound of his opponent 's voice . 
Count Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval ; several persons , briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase , said : `` That 's right , quite right ! 
Just so ! '' 
Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money , his serfs , or himself , only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to improve it , but he was unable to speak . 
Many voices shouted and talked at the same time , so that Count Rostov had not time to signify his approval of them all , and the group increased , dispersed , re-formed , and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table . 
Not only was Pierre 's attempt to speak unsuccessful , but he was rudely interrupted , pushed aside , and people turned away from him as from a common enemy . 
This happened not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech , which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches , but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate . 
Pierre became the latter . 
Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman , and all in the same tone . 
Many spoke eloquently and with originality . 
Glinka , the editor of the Russian Messenger , who was recognized -LRB- cries of `` author ! 
author ! '' 
were heard in the crowd -RRB- , said that `` hell must be repulsed by hell , '' and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps , but `` we will not be that child . '' 
`` Yes , yes , at thunderclaps ! '' 
was repeated approvingly in the back rows of the crowd . 
The crowd drew up to the large table , at which sat gray-haired or bald seventy-year-old magnates , uniformed and besashed almost all of whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons , or playing boston at the clubs . 
With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the table . 
Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs , the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together . 
Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it . 
Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it . 
The old magnates , whom Pierre knew , sat and turned to look first at one and then at another , and their faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very hot . 
Pierre , however , felt excited , and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all lengths -- which found expression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches -- infected him too . 
He did not renounce his opinions , but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself . 
`` I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when we know what is needed ! '' 
said he , trying to be heard above the other voices . 
One of the old men nearest to him looked round , but his attention was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table . 
`` Yes , Moscow will be surrendered ! 
She will be our expiation ! '' 
shouted one man . 
`` He is the enemy of mankind ! '' 
cried another . 
`` Allow me to speak ... '' `` Gentlemen , you are crushing me ! 
... '' At that moment Count Rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert eyes , wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder , entered the room , stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry . 
`` Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment , '' said Rostopchin . 
`` I am straight from the palace . 
Seeing the position we are in , I think there is little need for discussion . 
The Emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants . 
Millions will pour forth from there '' -- he pointed to the merchants ' hall -- `` but our business is to supply men and not spare ourselves ... That is the least we can do ! '' 
A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table . 
The whole consultation passed more than quietly . 
After all the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another , `` I agree , '' or for variety , `` I too am of that opinion , '' and so on had even a mournful effect . 
The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow nobility and gentry , that they would furnish ten men , fully equipped , out of every thousand serfs , as the Smolensk gentry had done . 
Their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent relief , and began walking up and down , arm in arm , to stretch their legs and converse in couples . 
`` The Emperor ! 
The Emperor ! '' 
a sudden cry resounded through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance . 
The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of nobles . 
Every face expressed respectful , awe-struck curiosity . 
Pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said . 
From what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow nobility . 
He was answered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at . 
`` Gentlemen ! '' 
said the Emperor with a quivering voice . 
There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided , so that Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying with emotion : `` I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles , but today it has surpassed my expectations . 
I thank you in the name of the Fatherland ! 
Gentlemen , let us act ! 
Time is most precious ... '' The Emperor ceased speaking , the crowd began pressing round him , and rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides . 
`` Yes , most precious ... a royal word , '' said Count Rostov , with a sob . 
He stood at the back , and , though he had heard hardly anything , understood everything in his own way . 
From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants . 
There he remained about ten minutes . 
Pierre was among those who saw him come out from the merchants ' hall with tears of emotion in his eyes . 
As became known later , he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice . 
When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants , one of whom Pierre knew , a fat otkupshchik . 
The other was the mayor , a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard . 
Both were weeping . 
Tears filled the thin man 's eyes , and the fat otkupshchik sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating : `` Our lives and property -- take them , Your Majesty ! '' 
Pierre 's one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything . 
He now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it . 
Having heard that Count Mamonov was furnishing a regiment , Bezukhov at once informed Rostopchin that he would give a thousand men and their maintenance . 
Old Rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears , and at once consented to Petya 's request and went himself to enter his name . 
Next day the Emperor left Moscow . 
The assembled nobles all took off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs , and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment , feeling amazed themselves at what they had done . 
Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going to Dresden , could not help having his head turned by the homage he received , could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a June morning , and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of Kurakin and then of Balashev . 
Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted . 
Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best way , because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander . 
Rostov charged the French because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field ; and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics , habits , circumstances , and aims . 
They were moved by fear or vanity , rejoiced or were indignant , reasoned , imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will , but they all were involuntary tools of history , carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us . 
Such is the inevitable fate of men of action , and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free . 
The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage , their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace , and nothing remains of that time but its historic results . 
Providence compelled all these men , striving to attain personal aims , to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expected -- neither Napoleon , nor Alexander , nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting . 
The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us now . 
No one will deny that that cause was , on the one hand , its advance into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and , on the other , the character given to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the Russian people . 
But no one at the time foresaw -LRB- what now seems so evident -RRB- that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men -- the best in the world and led by the best general -- could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength , and led by inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was . 
Not only did no one see this , but on the Russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save Russia , while on the French side , despite Napoleon 's experience and so-called military genius , every effort was directed to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer , that is , to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction . 
In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line , that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk , and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood . 
Russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia , and this plan some of them attribute to Pfuel , others to a certain Frenchman , others to Toll , and others again to Alexander himself - pointing to notes , projects , and letters which contain hints of such a line of action . 
But all these hints at what happened , both from the French side and the Russian , are advanced only because they fit in with the event . 
Had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten , as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them . 
There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say : `` I said then that it would be so , '' quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect . 
Conjectures as to Napoleon 's awareness of the danger of extending his line , and -LRB- on the Russian side -RRB- as to luring the enemy into the depths of Russia , are evidently of that kind , and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals , or such plans to the Russian commanders . 
All the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures . 
During the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country , but from their first entry into Russia everything was done to stop them . 
And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his line , but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns , but very lazily . 
At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided , and our sole aim was to unite them , though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country . 
Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian soil and not to retreat . 
The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel 's plan , and there was no intention of retiring farther . 
The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired . 
He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smolensk , still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow , and when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smolensk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls . 
So thought the Emperor , and the Russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country . 
Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement . 
In August he was at Smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther , though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him . 
The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on Moscow , nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then think of luring Napoleon on , but quite the contrary . 
The luring of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan , for no one believed it to be possible ; it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues , aims , and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable , or of the one way of saving Russia . 
Everything came about fortuitously . 
The armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign . 
We tried to unite them , with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy 's advance , and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy , and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle -- we led the French on to Smolensk . 
But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies ; the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther , because Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagration -LRB- who would come his command -RRB- , and Bagration -- being in command of the second army -- tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay 's command as long as he could . 
Bagration was slow in effecting the junction -- though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters -- because , as he alleged , he exposed his army to danger on this march , and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south , worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his army ; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner Barclay , whose rank was inferior to his own . 
The Emperor was with the army to encourage it , but his presence and ignorance of what steps to take , and the enormous number of advisers and plans , destroyed the first army 's energy and it retired . 
The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp , but Paulucci , aiming at becoming commander in chief , unexpectedly employed his energy to influence Alexander , and Pfuel 's whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay . 
But as Barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited . 
The armies were divided , there was no unity of command , and Barclay was unpopular ; but from this confusion , division , and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief , there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle -LRB- which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else , instead of Barclay , been in command -RRB- and on the other an ever-increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal . 
At last the Emperor left the army , and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war . 
And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled . 
He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief 's undivided control of the army , and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken , but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled . 
Bennigsen , the Tsarevich , and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy , and Barclay , feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these `` eyes of the Emperor , '' became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle . 
Barclay stood for caution . 
The Tsarevich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement . 
Lubomirski , Bronnitski , Wlocki , and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay , under pretext of sending papers to the Emperor , dispatched these Polish adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with Bennigsen and the Tsarevich . 
At Smolensk the armies at last reunited , much as Bagration disliked it . 
Bagration drove up in a carriage to to the house occupied by Barclay . 
Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer Bagration . 
Despite his seniority in rank Bagration , in this contest of magnanimity , took his orders from Barclay , but , having submitted , agreed with him less than ever . 
By the Emperor 's orders Bagration reported direct to him . 
He wrote to Arakcheev , the Emperor 's confidant : `` It must be as my sovereign pleases , but I can not work with the Minister -LRB- meaning Barclay -RRB- . 
For God 's sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment . 
I can not stand it here . 
Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian can not exist and there is no sense in anything . 
I thought I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland , but it turns out that I am serving Barclay . 
I confess I do not want to . '' 
The swarm of Bronnitskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief , and even less unity resulted . 
Preparations were made to fight the French before Smolensk . 
A general was sent to survey the position . 
This general , hating Barclay , rode to visit a friend of his own , a corps commander , and , having spent the day with him , returned to Barclay and condemned , as unsuitable from every point of view , the battleground he had not seen . 
While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle , and while we were looking for the French -- having lost touch with them -- the French stumbled upon Neverovski 's division and reached the walls of Smolensk . 
It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolensk to save our lines of communication . 
The battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides . 
Smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the whole people . 
But Smolensk was burned by its own inhabitants-who had been misled by their governor . 
And these ruined inhabitants , setting an example to other Russians , went to Moscow thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe . 
Napoleon advanced farther and we retired , thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction . 
The day after his son had left , Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary to come to his study . 
`` Well ? 
Are you satisfied now ? '' 
said he . 
`` You 've made me quarrel with my son ! 
Satisfied , are you ? 
That 's all you wanted ! 
Satisfied ? 
... It hurts me , it hurts . 
I 'm old and weak and this is what you wanted . 
Well then , gloat over it ! 
Gloat over it ! '' 
After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week . 
He was ill and did not leave his study . 
Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room , but did not admit Mademoiselle Bourienne either . 
Tikhon alone attended him . 
At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life , devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
His looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say : `` There , you see ? 
You plotted against me , you lied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him , but you see I need neither her nor you ! '' 
Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas , watching his lessons , teaching him Russian and music herself , and talking to Dessalles ; the rest of the day she spent over her books , with her old nurse , or with `` God 's folk '' who sometimes came by the back door to see her . 
Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars . 
She feared for her brother who was in it , was horrified by and amazed at the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another , but she did not understand the significance of this war , which seemed to her like all previous wars . 
She did not realize the significance of this war , though Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her , and though the `` God 's folk '' who came to see her reported , in their own way , the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist , and though Julie -LRB- now Princess Drubetskaya -RRB- , who had resumed correspondence with her , wrote patriotic letters from Moscow . 
`` I write you in Russian , my good friend , '' wrote Julie in her Frenchified Russian , `` because I have a detestation for all the French , and the same for their language which I can not support to hear spoken ... . 
We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor . 
`` My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns , but the news which I have inspires me yet more . 
`` You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raevski , embracing his two sons and saying : ' I will perish with them but we will not be shaken ! ' 
And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we , we were unshakable . 
We pass the time as we can , but in war as in war ! 
The princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me , and we , unhappy widows of live men , make beautiful conversations over our charpie , only you , my friend , are missing ... '' and so on . 
The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it , did not recognize it , and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner . 
The prince 's tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary unhesitatingly believed him . 
All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated . 
He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs . 
The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and , instead of sleeping in his study as usual , changed his sleeping place every day . 
One day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery , another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing , while -- instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne -- a serf boy read to him . 
Then again he would spend a night in the dining room . 
On August 1 , a second letter was received from Prince Andrew . 
In his first letter which came soon after he had left home , Prince Andrew had dutifully asked his father 's forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor . 
To this letter the old prince had replied affectionately , and from that time had kept the Frenchwoman at a distance . 
Prince Andrew 's second letter , written near Vitebsk after the French had occupied that town , gave a brief account of the whole campaign , enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war . 
In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills , so near the theater of war and on the army 's direct line of march , and advised him to move to Moscow . 
At dinner that day , on Dessalles ' mentioning that the French were said to have already entered Vitebsk , the old prince remembered his son 's letter . 
`` There was a letter from Prince Andrew today , '' he said to Princess Mary -- `` Have n't you read it ? '' 
`` No , Father , '' she replied in a frightened voice . 
She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had arrived . 
`` He writes about this war , '' said the prince , with the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war . 
`` That must be very interesting , '' said Dessalles . 
`` Prince Andrew is in a position to know ... '' `` Oh , very interesting ! '' 
said Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` Go and get it for me , '' said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` You know -- under the paperweight on the little table . '' 
Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly . 
`` No , do n't ! '' 
he exclaimed with a frown . 
`` You go , Michael Ivanovich . '' 
Michael Ivanovich rose and went to the study . 
But as soon as he had left the room the old prince , looking uneasily round , threw down his napkin and went himself . 
`` They ca n't do anything ... always make some muddle , '' he muttered . 
While he was away Princess Mary , Dessalles , Mademoiselle Bourienne , and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence . 
The old prince returned with quick steps , accompanied by Michael Ivanovich , bringing the letter and a plan . 
These he put down beside him -- not letting anyone read them at dinner . 
On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and , spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it , told her to read the letter aloud . 
When she had done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father . 
He was examining the plan , evidently engrossed in his own ideas . 
`` What do you think of it , Prince ? '' 
Dessalles ventured to ask . 
`` I ? 
I ? 
... '' said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened , and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building . 
`` Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that ... '' `` Ha ha ha ! 
The theater of war ! '' 
said the prince . 
`` I have said and still say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get beyond the Niemen . '' 
Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince , who was talking of the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper , but Princess Mary , forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen , thought that what her father was saying was correct . 
`` When the snow melts they 'll sink in the Polish swamps . 
Only they could fail to see it , '' the prince continued , evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent . 
`` Bennigsen should have advanced into Prussia sooner , then things would have taken a different turn ... '' `` But , Prince , '' Dessalles began timidly , `` the letter mentions Vitebsk ... '' `` Ah , the letter ? 
Yes ... '' replied the prince peevishly . 
`` Yes ... yes ... '' His face suddenly took on a morose expression . 
He paused . 
`` Yes , he writes that the French were beaten at ... at ... what river is it ? '' 
Dessalles dropped his eyes . 
`` The prince says nothing about that , '' he remarked gently . 
`` Does n't he ? 
But I did n't invent it myself . '' 
No one spoke for a long time . 
`` Yes ... yes ... Well , Michael Ivanovich , '' he suddenly went on , raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building , `` tell me how you mean to alter it ... '' Michael Ivanovich went up to the plan , and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and went to his own room . 
Princess Mary saw Dessalles ' embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father , noticed his silence , and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his son 's letter on the drawing-room table ; but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence , but was afraid even to think about it . 
In the evening Michael Ivanovich , sent by the prince , came to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew 's letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room . 
She gave it to him and , unpleasant as it was to her to do so , ventured to ask him what her father was doing . 
`` Always busy , '' replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale . 
`` He 's worrying very much about the new building . 
He has been reading a little , but now '' -- Michael Ivanovich went on , lowering his voice -- `` now he 's at his desk , busy with his will , I expect . '' 
-LRB- One of the prince 's favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his `` will . '' -RRB- 
`` And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk ? '' 
asked Princess Mary . 
`` Oh , yes , he has been waiting to start for some time . '' 
When Michael Ivanovich returned to the study with the letter , the old prince , with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes , was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles , holding a paper in his outstretched hand , and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript -- his `` Remarks '' as he termed it -- which was to be transmitted to the Emperor after his death . 
When Michael Ivanovich went in there were tears in the prince 's eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had been written . 
He took the letter from Michael Ivanovich 's hand , put it in his pocket , folded up his papers , and called in Alpatych who had long been waiting . 
The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolensk and , walking up and down the room past Alpatych who stood by the door , he gave his instructions . 
`` First , notepaper -- do you hear ? 
Eight quires , like this sample , gilt-edged ... it must be exactly like the sample . 
Varnish , sealing wax , as in Michael Ivanovich 's list . '' 
He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes . 
`` Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed . '' 
Next , bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed , and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the `` will '' in . 
The instructions to Alpatych took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go . 
He sat down , sank into thought , closed his eyes , and dozed off . 
Alpatych made a slight movement . 
`` Well , go , go ! 
If anything more is wanted I 'll send after you . '' 
Alpatych went out . 
The prince again went to his bureau , glanced into it , fingered his papers , closed the bureau again , and sat down at the table to write to the governor . 
It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter . 
He wished to sleep , but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed . 
So he called Tikhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night . 
He went about looking at every corner . 
Every place seemed unsatisfactory , but worst of all was his customary couch in the study . 
That couch was dreadful to him , probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when lying there . 
It was unsatisfactory everywhere , but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places : he had never slept there yet . 
With the help of a footman Tikhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up . 
`` That 's not right ! 
That 's not right ! '' 
cried the prince , and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again . 
`` Well , at last I 've finished , now I 'll rest , '' thought the prince , and let Tikhon undress him . 
Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers , the prince undressed , sat down heavily on the bed , and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs . 
He was not meditating , but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed . 
`` Ugh , how hard it is ! 
Oh , that this toil might end and you would release me ! '' 
thought he . 
Pressing his lips together he made that effort for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down . 
But hardly had he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting . 
This happened to him almost every night . 
He opened his eyes as they were closing . 
`` No peace , damn them ! '' 
he muttered , angry he knew not with whom . 
`` Ah yes , there was something else important , very important , that I was keeping till I should be in bed . 
The bolts ? 
No , I told him about them . 
No , it was something , something in the drawing room . 
Princess Mary talked some nonsense . 
Dessalles , that fool , said something . 
Something in my pocket -- ca n't remember ... '' `` Tikhon , what did we talk about at dinner ? '' 
`` About Prince Michael ... '' `` Be quiet , quiet ! '' 
The prince slapped his hand on the table . 
`` Yes , I know , Prince Andrew 's letter ! 
Princess Mary read it .
