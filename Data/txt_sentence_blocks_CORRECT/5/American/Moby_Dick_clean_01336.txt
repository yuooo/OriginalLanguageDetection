This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon 's wisdom yet . 
But he who dodges hospitals and jails , and walks fast crossing graveyards , and would rather talk of operas than hell ; calls Cowper , Young , Pascal , Rousseau , poor devils all of sick men ; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise , and therefore jolly ; -- not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones , and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon . 
But even Solomon , he says , `` the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain '' -LRB- i.e. even while living -RRB- `` in the congregation of the dead . '' 
Give not thyself up , then , to fire , lest it invert thee , deaden thee ; as for the time it did me . 
There is a wisdom that is woe ; but there is a woe that is madness .
