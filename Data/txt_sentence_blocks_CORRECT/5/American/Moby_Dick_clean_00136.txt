So disordered , self-condemning is his look , that had there been policemen in those days , Jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been arrested ere he touched a deck . 
How plainly he 's a fugitive ! 
no baggage , not a hat-box , valise , or carpet-bag , -- no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux . 
At last , after much dodging search , he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods , to mark the stranger 's evil eye . 
Jonah sees this ; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence ; in vain essays his wretched smile .
