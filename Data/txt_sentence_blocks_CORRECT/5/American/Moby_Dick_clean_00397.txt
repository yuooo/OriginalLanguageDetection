Tashtego was Stubb the second mate 's squire . 
Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo , a gigantic , coal-black negro-savage , with a lion-like tread -- an Ahasuerus to behold . 
Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them ringbolts , and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them . 
In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast . 
And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa , Nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by the whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues , and erect as a giraffe , moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks .
