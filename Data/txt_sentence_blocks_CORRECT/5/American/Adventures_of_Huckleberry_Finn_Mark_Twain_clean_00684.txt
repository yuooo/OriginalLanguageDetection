He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands , and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while ; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning , and jumps for the king , goo-gooing with all his might for joy , and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up . 
Then the king says , `` I knowed it ; I reckon THAT 'll convince anybody the way HE feels about it . 
Here , Mary Jane , Susan , Joanner , take the money -- take it ALL . 
It 's the gift of him that lays yonder , cold but joyful . '' 
Mary Jane she went for him , Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke , and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet .
