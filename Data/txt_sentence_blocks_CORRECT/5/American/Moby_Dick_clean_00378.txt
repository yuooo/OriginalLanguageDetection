I know a man that , in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales . 
I account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns . 
And , as for me , if , by any possibility , there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me ; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of ; if hereafter I shall do anything that , upon the whole , a man might rather have done than to have left undone ; if , at my death , my executors , or more properly my creditors , find any precious MSS . 
in my desk , then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling ; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard . 
Postscript In behalf of the dignity of whaling , I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts .
