And it did n't . 
He told me what it was , and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style , and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would , and maybe get us all killed besides . 
So I was satisfied , and said we would waltz in on it . 
I need n't tell what it was here , because I knowed it would n't stay the way , it was . 
I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along , and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance .
