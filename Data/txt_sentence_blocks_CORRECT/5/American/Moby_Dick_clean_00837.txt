` The White Whale -- the White Whale ! ' 
was the cry from captain , mates , and harpooneers , who , undeterred by fearful rumours , were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish ; while the dogged crew eyed askance , and with curses , the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass , that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun , shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea . 
Gentlemen , a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events , as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted . 
The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate , and when fast to a fish , it was his duty to sit next him , while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or slacken the line , at the word of command . 
Moreover , when the four boats were lowered , the mate 's got the start ; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt , as he strained at his oar .
