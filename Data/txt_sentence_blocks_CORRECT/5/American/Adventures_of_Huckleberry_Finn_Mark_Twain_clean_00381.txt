So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through , just as it happened , only he painted it up considerable . 
Then he said he must start in and '' ` terpret '' it , because it was sent for a warning . 
He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good , but the current was another man that would get us away from him . 
The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then , and if we did n't try hard to make out to understand them they 'd just take us into bad luck , ` stead of keeping us out of it . 
The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks , but if we minded our business and did n't talk back and aggravate them , we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river , which was the free States , and would n't have no more trouble .
