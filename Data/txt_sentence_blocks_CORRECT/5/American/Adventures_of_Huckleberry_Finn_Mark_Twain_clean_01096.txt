UNKNOWN FRIEND . 
WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast , and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing , with a lunch , and had a good time , and took a look at the raft and found her all right , and got home late to supper , and found them in such a sweat and worry they did n't know which end they was standing on , and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper , and would n't tell us what the trouble was , and never let on a word about the new letter , but did n't need to , because we knowed as much about it as anybody did , and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cubboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed , and got up about half - past eleven , and Tom put on Aunt Sally 's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch , but says : `` Where 's the butter ? '' 
`` I laid out a hunk of it , '' I says , `` on a piece of a corn-pone . '' 
`` Well , you LEFT it laid out , then -- it ai n't here . '' 
`` We can get along without it , '' I says .
