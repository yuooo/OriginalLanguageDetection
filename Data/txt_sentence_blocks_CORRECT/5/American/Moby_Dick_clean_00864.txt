For all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last . 
True , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness . 
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like . 
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him . 
Wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan .
