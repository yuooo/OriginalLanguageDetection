Well , then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off , because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there . 
So , says I , I 'll keep a lookout , and if any of them 's floating around after me I 'll give them a show . 
I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have , and I war n't disappointed . 
A big double loaf come along , and I most got it with a long stick , but my foot slipped and she floated out further . 
Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore -- I knowed enough for that .
