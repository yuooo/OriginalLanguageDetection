In about half an hour Tom 's wagon drove up to the front stile , and Aunt Sally she see it through the window , because it was only about fifty yards , and says : `` Why , there 's somebody come ! 
I wonder who 't is ? 
Why , I do believe it 's a stranger . 
Jimmy '' -LRB- that 's one of the children -RRB- `` run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner . '' 
Everybody made a rush for the front door , because , of course , a stranger do n't come EVERY year , and so he lays over the yaller-fever , for interest , when he does come .
