Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels , which vessels , when he quits the surface , are completely distended with oxygenated blood .

The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable ; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true , seems the more cogent to me , when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out , as the fishermen phrase it . 
This is what I mean .
