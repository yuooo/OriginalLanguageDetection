In three minutes , a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb . 
Out from the centre of the sea , poor Pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest . 
Now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore . 
But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable . 
The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my God !
