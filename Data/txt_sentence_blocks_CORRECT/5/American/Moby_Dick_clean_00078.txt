But there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen . 
Going to his heavy grego , or wrapall , or dreadnaught , which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back , and exactly the color of a three days ' old Congo baby . 
Remembering the embalmed head , at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner . 
But seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony , I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be . 
For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place , and removing the papered fire-board , sets up this little hunch-backed image , like a tenpin , between the andirons .
