In the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and disentangling itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide , new slid from the hills . 
Thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it subsided , and sank . 
Then once more arose , and silently gleamed . 
It seemed not a whale ; and yet is this Moby Dick ? 
thought Daggoo .
