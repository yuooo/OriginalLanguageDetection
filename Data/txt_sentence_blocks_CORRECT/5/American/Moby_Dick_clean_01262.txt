The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud `` In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan , insufferable fetor denying not inquiry . '' 
SIR T. BROWNE , V. E . 
It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted , and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy , vapory , mid-day sea , that the many noses on the Pequod 's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft . 
A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea . 
`` I will bet something now , '' said Stubb , `` that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day .
