-- oh , no , I reckon not ! 
And there war n't a blessed snake up there when we went back -- we did n't half tie the sack , and they worked out somehow , and left . 
But it did n't matter much , because they was still on the premises somewheres . 
So we judged we could get some of them again . 
No , there war n't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell .
