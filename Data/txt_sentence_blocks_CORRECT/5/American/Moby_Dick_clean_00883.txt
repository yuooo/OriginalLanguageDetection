Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews , when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews . 
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned . 
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships . 
No mercy , no power but its own controls it . 
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe .
