According to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam . 
His story was this : He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trapdoor , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest-pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum . 
A strange , apostolic whim having seized him , he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady , common sense exterior , and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam 's whaling voyage . 
They engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship 's getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a freshet . 
He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel , and commanded the captain to jump overboard .
