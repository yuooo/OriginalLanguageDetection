An intense copper calm , like a universal yellow lotus , was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea . 
A short space elapsed , and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin . 
Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb 's long spade still remaining there after the whale 's decapitation and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass , placed its other end crutchwise under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head . 
It was a black and hooded head ; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm , it seemed the Sphynx 's in the desert . 
`` Speak , thou vast and venerable head , '' muttered Ahab , `` which , though ungarnished with a beard , yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses ; speak , mighty head , and tell us the secret thing that is in thee .
