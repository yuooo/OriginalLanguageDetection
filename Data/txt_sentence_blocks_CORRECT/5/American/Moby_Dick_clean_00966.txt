But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod 's sharks ; though , to be sure , any man unaccustomed to such sights , to have looked over her side that night , would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese , and those sharks the maggots in it . 
Nevertheless , upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was concluded ; and when , accordingly Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck , no small excitement was created among the sharks ; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side , and lowering three lanterns , so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea , these two mariners , darting their long whaling-spades , * kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks , by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls , seemingly their only vital part . 
But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts , the marksmen could not always hit their mark ; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe . 
They viciously snapped , not only at each other 's disembowelments , but like flexible bows , bent round , and bit their own ; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth , to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound . 
Nor was this all .
