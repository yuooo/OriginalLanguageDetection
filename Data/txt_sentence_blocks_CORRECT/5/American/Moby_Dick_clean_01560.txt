For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain ; and one of them by Ahab . 
It was far down the afternoon ; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done ; and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky , sun and whale both stilly died together ; then , such a sweetness and such plaintiveness , such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air , that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles , the Spanish land-breeze , wantonly turned sailor , had gone to sea , freighted with these vesper hymns . 
Soothed again , but only soothed to deeper gloom , Ahab , who had sterned off from the whale , sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat . 
For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying -- the turning sunwards of the head , and so expiring -- that strange spectacle , beheld of such a placid evening , somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before . 
`` He turns and turns him to it , -- how slowly , but how steadfastly , his homage-rendering and invoking brow , with his last dying motions .
