`` Nor had I. And the snow had warned me of other dangers . 
I could not go abroad in snow -- it would settle on me and expose me . 
Rain , too , would make me a watery outline , a glistening surface of a man -- a bubble .

Moreover , as I went abroad -- in the London air -- I gathered dirt about my ankles , floating smuts and dust upon my skin .
