It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft , but it was clearing up again now . 
`` Oh , well , that 's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes , Jim , '' I says ; `` but what does THESE things stand for ? '' 
It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar . 
You could see them first-rate now . 
Jim looked at the trash , and then looked at me , and back at the trash again .
