But never mind . 
We workers in woods make bridal bedsteads and card-tables , as well as coffins and hearses . 
We work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded cobbling , and then we stash it if we can . 
Hem ! 
I 'll do the job , now , tenderly .
