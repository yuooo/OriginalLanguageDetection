We smouched the grindstone , and set out to roll her home , but it was a most nation tough job . 
Sometimes , do what we could , we could n't keep her from falling over , and she come mighty near mashing us every time . 
Tom said she was going to get one of us , sure , before we got through . 
We got her half way ; and then we was plumb played out , and most drownded with sweat . 
We see it war n't no use ; we got to go and fetch Jim So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg , and wrapt it round and round his neck , and we crawled out through our hole and down there , and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing ; and Tom superintended .
