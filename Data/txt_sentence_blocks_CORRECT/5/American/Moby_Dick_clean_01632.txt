Not reasoning ; not remonstrance ; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to ; all this thou scornest . 
Flat obedience to thy own flat commands , this is all thou breathest . 
Aye , and say ` st the men have vow 'd thy vow ; say ` st all of us are Ahabs . 
Great God forbid ! 
-- But is there no other way ?
