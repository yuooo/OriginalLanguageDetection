The Pacific When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea ; were it not for other things I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks , for now the long supplication of my youth was answered ; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue . 
There is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful stirrings seems to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St. John . 
And meet it is , that over these sea-pastures , wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters ' Fields of all four continents , the waves should rise and fall , and ebb and flow unceasingly ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , somnambulisms , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like slumberers in their beds ; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness . 
To any meditative Magian rover , this serene Pacific , once beheld , must ever after be the sea of his adoption . 
It rolls the midmost waters of the world , the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms .
