You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground . 
I did wish Tom Sawyer was there ; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business , and throw in the fancy touches . 
Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that . 
Well , last I pulled out some of my hair , and blooded the axe good , and stuck it on the back side , and slung the axe in the corner . 
Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket -LRB- so he could n't drip -RRB- till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river .
