But as for Queequeg -- why , Queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle . 
To be sure I can not say much for his breeding . 
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him . 
But that was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people 's estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly . 
We will not speak of all Queequeg 's peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare .
