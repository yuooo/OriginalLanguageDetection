A body ca n't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las ' . 
But you is all right . 
You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo ' life , en considable joy . 
Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt , en sometimes you gwyne to git sick ; but every time you 's gwyne to git well agin . 
Dey 's two gals flyin ' ` bout you in yo ' life .
