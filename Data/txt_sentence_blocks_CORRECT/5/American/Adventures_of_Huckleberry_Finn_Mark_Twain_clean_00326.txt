`` She was a-visiting there at Booth 's Landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend 's house , Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name -- and they lost their steering-oar , and swung around and went a - floating down , stern first , about two mile , and saddle-baggsed on the wreck , and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck . 
Well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow , and it was so dark we did n't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so WE saddle-baggsed ; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple -- and oh , he WAS the best cretur ! 
-- I most wish ' t it had been me , I do . '' 
`` My George ! 
It 's the beatenest thing I ever struck .
