I fetched out the gun , and now I was done . 
I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things . 
So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place , which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust . 
Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place , and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there , for it was bent up at that place and did n't quite touch ground . 
If you stood four or five foot away and did n't know it was sawed , you would n't never notice it ; and besides , this was the back of the cabin , and it war n't likely anybody would go fooling around there .
