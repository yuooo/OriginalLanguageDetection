Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less . 
For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him . 
Peace and satisfaction , thought Flask , have for ever departed from my stomach . 
I am an officer ; but , how I wish I could fist a bit of old-fashioned beef in the fore-castle , as I used to when I was before the mast . 
There 's the fruits of promotion now ; there 's the vanity of glory : there 's the insanity of life !
