The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull , within a few inches of the sleepers ' hearts . 
Peering over the side you could just see them -LRB- as before you heard them -RRB- wallowing in the sullen , black waters , and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head . 
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous . 
How at such an apparently unassailable surface , they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls , remains a part of the universal problem of all things . 
The mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw .
