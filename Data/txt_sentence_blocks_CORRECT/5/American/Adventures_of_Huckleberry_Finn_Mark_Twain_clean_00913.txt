Well , I could n't HAVE it that way ; it would n't do at all . 
I must go up the road and waylay him . 
So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage . 
The old gentleman was for going along with me , but I said no , I could drive the horse myself , and I druther he would n't take no trouble about me . 
SO I started for town in the wagon , and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming , and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer , and I stopped and waited till he come along .
