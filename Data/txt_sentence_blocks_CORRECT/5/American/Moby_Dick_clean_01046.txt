Now , if he 's so old as all those hoops of yours come to , and if he is going to live for ever , what good will it do to pitch him overboard -- tell me that ? 
`` Give him a good ducking , anyhow . '' 
`` But he 'd crawl back . '' 
`` Duck him again ; and keep ducking him . '' 
`` Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you , though -- yes , and drown you -- what then ? ''
