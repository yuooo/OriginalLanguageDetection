Jim did n't say nothing for about five minutes , but set there studying over it . 
Then he says : `` Well , den , I reck 'n I did dream it , Huck ; but dog my cats ef it ai n't de powerfullest dream I ever see . 
En I hai n't ever had no dream b ` fo ' dat 's tired me like dis one . '' 
`` Oh , well , that 's all right , because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes . 
But this one was a staving dream ; tell me all about it , Jim . ''
