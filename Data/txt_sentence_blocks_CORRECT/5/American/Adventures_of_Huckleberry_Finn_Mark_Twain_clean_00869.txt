Why , it was astonishing , the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off , and my troubles all gone . 
So I got a piece of paper and a pencil , all glad and excited , and set down and wrote : Miss Watson , your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville , and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send . 
HUCK FINN . 
I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life , and I knowed I could pray now . 
But I did n't do it straight off , but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so , and how near I come to being lost and going to hell .
