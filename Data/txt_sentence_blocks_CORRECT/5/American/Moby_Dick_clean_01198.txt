Dissect him how I may , then , I but go skin deep . 
I know him not , and never will . 
But if I know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ? 
much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ? 
Thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen .
