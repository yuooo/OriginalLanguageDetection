We lived in that old cabin , and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights . 
He had a gun which he had stole , I reckon , and we fished and hunted , and that was what we lived on . 
Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store , three miles , to the ferry , and traded fish and game for whisky , and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time , and licked me . 
The widow she found out where I was by and by , and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me ; but pap drove him off with the gun , and it war n't long after that till I was used to being where I was , and liked it -- all but the cowhide part . 
It was kind of lazy and jolly , laying off comfortable all day , smoking and fishing , and no books nor study .
