It was all grass clear to the canoe , so I had n't left a track . 
I followed around to see . 
I stood on the bank and looked out over the river . 
All safe . 
So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods , and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig ; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms .
