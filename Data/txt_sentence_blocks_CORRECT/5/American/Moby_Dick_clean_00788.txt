`` It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the Town-Ho 's leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day . 
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom . 
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ! 
that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them .
