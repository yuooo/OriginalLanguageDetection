And his ill-shaped mouth fell apart , and a glairy foam lay on his lips , and his breath came hoarse and noisy . 
All he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down , and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste . 
And then presently , far up the hill , a dog playing in the road yelped and ran under a gate , and as they still wondered something -- a wind -- a pad , pad , pad , -- a sound like a panting breathing , rushed by . 
People screamed . 
People sprang off the pavement : It passed in shouts , it passed by instinct down the hill .
