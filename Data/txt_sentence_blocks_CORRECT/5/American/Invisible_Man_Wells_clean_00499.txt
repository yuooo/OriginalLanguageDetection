At last I opened the window and made a bustle . 
I suppose it went out at last . 
I never saw any more of it . 
`` Then -- Heaven knows why -- I fell thinking of my father 's funeral again , and the dismal windy hillside , until the day had come . 
I found sleeping was hopeless , and , locking my door after me , wandered out into the morning streets . ''
