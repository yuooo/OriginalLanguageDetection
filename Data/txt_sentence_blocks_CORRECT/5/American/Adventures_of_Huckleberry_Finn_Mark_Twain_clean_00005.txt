After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers , and I was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then I did n't care no more about him , because I do n't take no stock in dead people . 
Pretty soon I wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me . 
But she would n't . 
She said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and I must try to not do it any more . 
That is just the way with some people .
