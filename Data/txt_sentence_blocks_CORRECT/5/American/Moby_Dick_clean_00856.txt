In old Harris 's collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages , A.D. 1671 , entitled `` A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale , Peter Peterson of Friesland , master . '' 
In one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice-isles , with white bears running over their living backs . 
In another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes . 
Then again , there is an imposing quarto , written by one Captain Colnett , a Post Captain in the English navy , entitled `` A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas , for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries . '' 
In this book is an outline purporting to be a `` Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico , August , 1793 , and hoisted on deck . ''
