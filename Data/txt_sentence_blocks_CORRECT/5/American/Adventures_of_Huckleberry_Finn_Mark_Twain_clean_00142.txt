The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake . 
I dropped pap 's whetstone there too , so as to look like it had been done by accident . 
Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string , so it would n't leak no more , and took it and my saw to the canoe again . 
It was about dark now ; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank , and waited for the moon to rise . 
I made fast to a willow ; then I took a bite to eat , and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan .
