I do n't take no stock in mathematics , anyway . 
At first I hated the school , but by and by I got so I could stand it . 
Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey , and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up . 
So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be . 
I was getting sort of used to the widow 's ways , too , and they war n't so raspy on me .
