The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced ; Starbuck was directed to see to it ; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found , and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage , all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end , whatever that might prove to be ; therefore , they were going to leave the ship 's stern unprovided with a buoy , when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin . 
`` A life-buoy of a coffin ! '' 
cried Starbuck , starting . 
`` Rather queer , that , I should say , '' said Stubb . 
`` It will make a good enough one , '' said Flask , `` the carpenter here can arrange it easily . ''
