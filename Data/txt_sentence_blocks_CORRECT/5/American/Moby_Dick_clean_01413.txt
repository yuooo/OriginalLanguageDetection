But my friend Dr. Snodhead , a very learned man , professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Potts , to whom I handed the work for translation , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble -- this same Dr. Snodhead , so soon as he spied the book , assured me that `` Dan Coopman '' did not mean `` The Cooper , '' but `` The Merchant .

And in this chapter it was , headed , `` Smeer , '' or `` Fat , '' that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen ; from which list , as translated by Dr. Snodhead , I transcribe the following : 0084400,000 lbs . 
of beef . 
60,000 lbs .
