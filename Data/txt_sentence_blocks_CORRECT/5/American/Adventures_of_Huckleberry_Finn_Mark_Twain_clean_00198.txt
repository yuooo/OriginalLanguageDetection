Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain . 
He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way , and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it . 
I was going to catch some of them , but Jim would n't let me . 
He said it was death . 
He said his father laid mighty sick once , and some of them catched a bird , and his old granny said his father would die , and he did .
