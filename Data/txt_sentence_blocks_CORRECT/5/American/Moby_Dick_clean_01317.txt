Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men . 
The Cassock Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this post-mortemizing of the whale ; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass , pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange , enigmatical object , which you would have seen there , lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers . 
Not the wondrous cistern in the whale 's huge head ; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw ; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail ; none of these would so surprise you , as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone , -- longer than a Kentuckian is tall , nigh a foot in diameter at the base , and jet-black as Yojo , the ebony idol of Queequeg . 
And an idol , indeed , it is ; or rather , in old times , its likeness was . 
Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea ; and for worshipping which , King Asa , her son , did depose her , and destroyed the idol , and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron , as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings .
