I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief ; they cried around each other , and took on so it most made me down sick to see it . 
The girls said they had n't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town . 
I ca n't ever get it out of my memory , the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other 's necks and crying ; and I reckon I could n't a stood it all , but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I had n't knowed the sale war n't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two . 
The thing made a big stir in the town , too , and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way . 
It injured the frauds some ; but the old fool he bulled right along , spite of all the duke could say or do , and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy .
