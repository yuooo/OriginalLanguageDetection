Very good ; but there is more coming . 
Some weeks later , the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso . 
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale , that begged a few moments ' confidential business with him . 
That business consisted in fetching the Commodore 's craft such a thwack , that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair . 
I am not superstitious , but I consider the Commodore 's interview with that whale as providential .
