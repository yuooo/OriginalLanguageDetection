But go on , Ishmael , said I at last ; do n't you hear ? 
get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way . 
So on I went . 
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward , for there , doubtless , were the cheapest , if not the cheeriest inns . 
Such dreary streets !
