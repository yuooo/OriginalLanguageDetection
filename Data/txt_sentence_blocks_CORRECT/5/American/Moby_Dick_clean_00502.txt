Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship , and in moody phrase ejaculates : -- `` Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll ! 
Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain . '' 
Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient `` interest '' in the voyage ; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise . 
But all in vain ; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short-sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ? 
They have left their opera-glasses at home .
