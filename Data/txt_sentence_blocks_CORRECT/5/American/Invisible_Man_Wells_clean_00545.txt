My back had now become very stiff and sore , my tonsils were painful from the cabman 's fingers , and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his nails ; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a little cut on one foot . 
I saw in time a blind man approaching me , and fled limping , for I feared his subtle intuitions . 
Once or twice accidental collisions occurred and I left people amazed , with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears . 
Then came something silent and quiet against my face , and across the Square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow . 
I had caught a cold , and do as I would I could not avoid an occasional sneeze .
