Before it , far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters , went the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky forehead , a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade ; and behind , the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake ; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side . 
But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowls softly feathering the sea , alternate with their fitful flight ; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy , the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale 's back ; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering , and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail feathers streaming like pennons . 
A gentle joyousness -- a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness , invested the gliding whale . 
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns ; his lovely , leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid ; with smooth bewitching fleetness , rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete ; not Jove , not that great majesty Supreme ! 
did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam .
