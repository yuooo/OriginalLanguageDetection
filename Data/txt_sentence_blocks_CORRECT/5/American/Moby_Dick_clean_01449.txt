But the truth of the Matter is , that on either side of the Temple , there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea , and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em . 
They keep a Whale 's Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle , which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost , makes an Arch , the Head of which can not be reached by a Man upon a Camel 's Back . 
This Rib -LRB- says John Leo -RRB- is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it . 
Their Historians affirm , that a Prophet who prophesy 'd of Mahomet , came from this Temple , and some do not stand to assert , that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple . '' 
In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you , reader , and if you be a Nantucketer , and a whaleman , you will silently worship there .
