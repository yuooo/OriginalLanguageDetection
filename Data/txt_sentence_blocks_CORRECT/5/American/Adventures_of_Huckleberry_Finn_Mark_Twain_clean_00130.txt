I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog , clothes and all on , and struck out for the canoe . 
I just expected there 'd be somebody laying down in it , because people often done that to fool folks , and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they 'd raise up and laugh at him . 
But it war n't so this time . 
It was a drift-canoe sure enough , and I clumb in and paddled her ashore . 
Thinks I , the old man will be glad when he sees this -- she 's worth ten dollars .
