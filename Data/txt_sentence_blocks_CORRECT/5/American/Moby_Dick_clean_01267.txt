Issuing from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat 's crew , and pulled off for the stranger . 
Drawing across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste , the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk , was painted green , and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there ; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color . 
Upon her head boards , in large gilt letters , he read `` Bouton de Rose , '' -- Rose-button , or Rose-bud ; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship . 
Though Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription , yet the word rose , and the bulbous figure-head put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him . 
`` A wooden rose-bud , eh ? ''
