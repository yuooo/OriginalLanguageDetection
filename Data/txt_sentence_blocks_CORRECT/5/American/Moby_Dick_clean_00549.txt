this Iron Crown of Lombardy . 
Yet is it bright with many a gem ; I the wearer , see not its far flashings ; but darkly feel that I wear that , that dazzlingly confounds . 
'T is iron -- that I know -- not gold . 
'T is split , too -- that I feel ; the jagged edge galls me so , my brain seems to beat against the solid metal ; aye , steel skull , mine ; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight ! 
Dry heat upon my brow ?
