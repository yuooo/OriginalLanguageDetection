With other men , perhaps , such things would not have been inducements ; but as for me , I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote . 
I love to sail forbidden seas , and land on barbarous coasts . 
Not ignoring what is good , I am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it -- would they let me -- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in . 
By reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my inmost soul , endless processions of the whale , and , mid most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air .
