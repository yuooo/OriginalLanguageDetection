`` Honest , I 'll tell you everything just as it happened , your majesty . 
The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me , and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year , and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix ; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold , and made a rush for the coffin , he lets go of me and whispers , ` Heel it now , or they 'll hang ye , sure ! ' 
and I lit out . 
It did n't seem no good for ME to stay -- I could n't do nothing , and I did n't want to be hung if I could get away . 
So I never stopped running till I found the canoe ; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry , or they 'd catch me and hang me yet , and said I was afeard you and the duke was n't alive now , and I was awful sorry , and so was Jim , and was awful glad when we see you coming ; you may ask Jim if I did n't . ''
