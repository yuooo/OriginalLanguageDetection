He 's out of oil , and has come a-begging . '' 
However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the whale-ground , and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle , yet sometimes such a thing really happens ; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare . 
As he mounted the deck , Ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of Bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a clean one -LRB- that is , an empty one -RRB- , well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin . 
His necessities supplied , Derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship 's side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was Derick , that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders . 
Now , the game having risen to leeward , he and the other three German boats that soon followed him , had considerably the start of the Pequod 's keels .
