I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about ; I had to part the willow branches to get in ; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside . 
I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island , and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town , three mile away , where there was three or four lights twinkling . 
A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream , coming along down , with a lantern in the middle of it . 
I watched it come creeping down , and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say , `` Stern oars , there ! 
heave her head to stabboard ! ''
