I reckon I was up in the tree two hours ; but I did n't see nothing , I did n't hear nothing -- I only THOUGHT I heard and seen as much as a thousand things . 
Well , I could n't stay up there forever ; so at last I got down , but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time . 
All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast . 
By the time it was night I was pretty hungry . 
So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank -- about a quarter of a mile .
