`` Hold on a minute ; I hai n't had my say yit . 
You listen to me . 
Shooting 's good , but there 's quieter ways if the thing 's GOT to be done . 
But what I say is this : it ai n't good sense to go court 'n around after a halter if you can git at what you 're up to in some way that 's jist as good and at the same time do n't bring you into no resks . 
Ai n't that so ? ''
