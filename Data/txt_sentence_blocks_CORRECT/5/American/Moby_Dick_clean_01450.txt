Does the Whale 's Magnitude Diminish ? 
- Will He Perish ? 
Inasmuch , then , as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head-waters of the Eternities , it may be fitly inquired , whether , in the long course of his generations , he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires . 
But upon investigation we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system -LRB- embracing a distinct geological period prior to man -RRB- , but of the whales found in that Tertiary system , those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones . 
Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed , by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton .
