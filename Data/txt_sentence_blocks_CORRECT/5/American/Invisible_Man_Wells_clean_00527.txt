`` It occurred to me that the radiators , if they fell into the hands of some acute well-educated person , would give me away too much , and watching my opportunity , I came into the room and tilted one of the little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing , and smashed both apparatus . 
Then , while they were trying to explain the smash , I dodged out of the room and went softly downstairs . 
`` I went into one of the sitting-rooms and waited until they came down , still speculating and argumentative , all a little disappointed at finding no ` horrors , ' and all a little puzzled how they stood legally towards me . 
Then I slipped up again with a box of matches , fired my heap of paper and rubbish , put the chairs and bedding thereby , led the gas to the affair , by means of an india-rubber tube , and waving a farewell to the room left it for the last time . '' 
`` You fired the house ! ''
