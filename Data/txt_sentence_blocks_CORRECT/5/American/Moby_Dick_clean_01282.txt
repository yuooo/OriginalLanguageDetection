`` Thank him heartily ; but tell him it 's against my principles to drink with the man I 've diddled . 
In fact , tell him I must go . '' 
`` He says , Monsieur , that his principles wo n't admit of his drinking ; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then Monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it 's so calm they wo n't drift . '' 
By this time Stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect , -- that having a long tow-line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship 's side . 
While the Frenchman 's boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line .
