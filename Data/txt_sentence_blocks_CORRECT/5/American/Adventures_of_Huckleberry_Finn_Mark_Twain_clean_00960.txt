In the morning we was up at break of day , and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim -- if it WAS Jim that was being fed . 
The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields ; and Jim 's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things ; and whilst the others was leaving , the key come from the house . 
This nigger had a good-natured , chuckle-headed face , and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread . 
That was to keep witches off . 
He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights , and making him see all kinds of strange things , and hear all kinds of strange words and noises , and he did n't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life .
