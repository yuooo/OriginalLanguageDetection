Did n't that Dough-Boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man 's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled , and the sheets down at the foot , and the coverlid almost tied into knots , and the pillow a sort of frightful hot , as though a baked brick had been on it ? 
A hot old man ! 
I guess he 's got what some folks ashore call a conscience ; it 's a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say -- worse nor a toothache . 
Well , well ; I do n't know what it is , but the Lord keep me from catching it . 
He 's full of riddles ; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for , every night , as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects ; what 's that for , I should like to know ?
