Wake up by and by , and look to see what done it , and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream , so far off towards the other side you could n't tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel ; then for about an hour there would n't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see -- just solid lonesomeness . 
Next you 'd see a raft sliding by , away off yonder , and maybe a galoot on it chopping , because they 're most always doing it on a raft ; you 'd see the axe flash and come down -- you do n't hear nothing ; you see that axe go up again , and by the time it 's above the man 's head then you hear the K'CHUNK ! 
-- it had took all that time to come over the water . 
So we would put in the day , lazying around , listening to the stillness . 
Once there was a thick fog , and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats would n't run over them .
