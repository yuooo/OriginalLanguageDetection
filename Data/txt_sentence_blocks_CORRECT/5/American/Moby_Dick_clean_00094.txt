I then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch . 
Throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage 's side , as if it were a hatchet-faced baby . 
A pretty pickle , truly , thought I ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk ! 
`` Queequeg ! 
-- in the name of goodness , Queequeg , wake ! ''
