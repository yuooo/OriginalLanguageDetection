Now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host . 
* I am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs -LRB- Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket -RRB- are included by many naturalists among the whales . 
But as these pig-fish are a noisy , contemptible set , mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers , and feeding on wet hay , and especially as they do not spout , I deny their credentials as whales ; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology . 
First : According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS -LRB- subdivisible into CHAPTERS -RRB- , and these shall comprehend them all , both small and large .
