As if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus . 
All down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost . 
Only her lower sails were set . 
A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads . 
They seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising .
