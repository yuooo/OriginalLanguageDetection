Second : It is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his conflicts with man , he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail . 
In striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil . 
If it be made in the unobstructed air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible . 
No ribs of man or boat can withstand it . 
Your only salvation lies in eluding it ; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water , then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale-boat , and the elasticity of its materials , a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two , a sort of stitch in the side , is generally the most serious result .
