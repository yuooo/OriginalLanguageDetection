`` You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the same refractive index ; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index . 
And if you will consider only a second , you will see also that the powder of glass might be made to vanish in air , if its refractive index could be made the same as that of air ; for then there would be no refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to air . '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' said Kemp . 
`` But a man 's not powdered glass ! '' 
`` No , '' said Griffin .
