cried Stubb , `` that 's Christianity ; go on . '' 
`` No use goin ' on ; de dam willains will keep a scrougin ' and slappin ' each oder , Massa Stubb ; dey do n't hear one word ; no use a-preaching to such dam g ` uttons as you call 'em , till dare bellies is full , and dare bellies is bottomless ; and when dey do get 'em full , dey wont hear you den ; for den dey sink in de sea , go fast to sleep on de coral , and ca n't hear noting at all , no more , for eber and eber . '' 
`` Upon my soul , I am about of the same opinion ; so give the benediction , Fleece , and I 'll away to my supper . '' 
Upon this , Fleece , holding both hands over the fishy mob , raised his shrill voice , and cried -- `` Cussed fellow-critters ! 
Kick up de damndest row as ever you can ; fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust -- and den die . ''
