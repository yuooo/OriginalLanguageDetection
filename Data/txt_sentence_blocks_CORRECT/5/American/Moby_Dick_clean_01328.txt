The burning ship drove on , as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed . 
So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote , Canaris , issuing from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the Turkish frigates , and folded them in conflagrations . 
The hatch , removed from the top of the works , now afforded a wide hearth in front of them . 
Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers , always the whale-ship 's stokers . 
With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots , or stirred up the fires beneath , till the snaky flames darted , curling , out of the doors to catch them by the feet .
