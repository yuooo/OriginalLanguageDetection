I left my lair as the crowds diminished , and prowled cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop . 
I was really surprised to observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for sale during the day . 
All the boxes of goods , the hanging fabrics , the festoons of lace , the boxes of sweets in the grocery section , the displays of this and that , were being whipped down , folded up , slapped into tidy receptacles , and everything that could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them . 
Finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters , leaving the floor clear . 
Directly each of these young people had done , he or she made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as I have rarely observed in a shop assistant before .
