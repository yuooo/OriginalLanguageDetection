So the duke took his hands off and says : `` If you ever deny it again I 'll drown you . 
It 's WELL for you to set there and blubber like a baby -- it 's fitten for you , after the way you 've acted . 
I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything -- and I a-trusting you all the time , like you was my own father . 
You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers , and you never say a word for 'em . 
It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVE that rubbage .
