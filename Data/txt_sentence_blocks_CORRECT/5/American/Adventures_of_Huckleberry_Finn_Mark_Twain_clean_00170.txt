I went out in the woods and cooked a supper , and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a PLUNKETY-PLUNK , PLUNKETY-PLUNK , and says to myself , horses coming ; and next I hear people 's voices . 
I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could , and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out . 
I had n't got far when I hear a man say : `` We better camp here if we can find a good place ; the horses is about beat out . 
Let 's look around . '' 
I did n't wait , but shoved out and paddled away easy .
