There were eight whales , an average pod . 
Aware of their danger , they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind , rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness . 
They left a great , wide wake , as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea . 
Full in this rapid wake , and many fathoms in the rear , swam a huge , humped old bull , which by his comparatively slow progress , as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations over-growing him , seemed afflicted with the jaundice , or some other infirmity . 
Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance , seemed questionable ; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social .
