Then socks , a thick comforter , and then I went to the clothing place and got trousers , a lounge jacket , an overcoat and a slouch hat -- a clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down . 
I began to feel a human being again , and my next thought was food . 
`` Upstairs was a refreshment department , and there I got cold meat . 
There was coffee still in the urn , and I lit the gas and warmed it up again , and altogether I did not do badly . 
Afterwards , prowling through the place in search of blankets -- I had to put up at last with a heap of down quilts -- I came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits , more than was good for me indeed -- and some white burgundy .
