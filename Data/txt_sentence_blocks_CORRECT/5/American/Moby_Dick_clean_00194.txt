Sideways leaning , we sideways darted ; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes . 
So full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers , a lubber-like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable ; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro . 
But there were some boobies and bumpkins there , who , by their intense greenness , must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure . 
Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back . 
I thought the bumpkin 's hour of doom was come .
