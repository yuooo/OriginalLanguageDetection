My sole object was to get shelter from the snow , to get myself covered and warm ; then I might hope to plan . 
But even to me , an Invisible Man , the rows of London houses stood latched , barred , and bolted impregnably . 
`` Only one thing could I see clearly before me -- the cold exposure and misery of the snowstorm and the night . 
`` And then I had a brilliant idea . 
I turned down one of the roads leading from Gower Street to Tottenham Court Road , and found myself outside Omniums , the big establishment where everything is to be bought -- you know the place : meat , grocery , linen , furniture , clothing , oil paintings even -- a huge meandering collection of shops rather than a shop .
