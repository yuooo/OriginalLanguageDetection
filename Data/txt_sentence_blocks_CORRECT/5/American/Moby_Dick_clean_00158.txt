`` This , shipmates , this is that other lesson ; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it . 
Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty ! 
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale ! 
Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal ! 
Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness !
