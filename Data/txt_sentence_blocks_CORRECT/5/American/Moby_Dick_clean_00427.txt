And there 's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump . 
That 's what makes a blow from the hand , Flask , fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane . 
The living member -- that makes the living insult , my little man . 
And thinks I to myself all the while , mind , while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid -- so confoundedly contradictory was it all , all the while , I say , I was thinking to myself , ` what 's his leg now , but a cane - . 
a whale-bone cane .
