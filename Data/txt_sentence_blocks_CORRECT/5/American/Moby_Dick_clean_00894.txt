In length , the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms . 
Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm-pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded `` sheaves , '' or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the `` heart , '' or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese . 
As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody 's arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub . 
Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists . 
In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs .
