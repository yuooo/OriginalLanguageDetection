Tom said that what he meant was , we could steal anything we NEEDED . 
Well , I says , I needed the watermelon . 
But he said I did n't need it to get out of prison with ; there 's where the difference was . 
He said if I 'd a wanted it to hide a knife in , and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with , it would a been all right . 
So I let it go at that , though I could n't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon .
