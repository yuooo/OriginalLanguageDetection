I had no refuge , no appliances , no human being in the world in whom I could confide . 
To have told my secret would have given me away -- made a mere show and rarity of me . 
Nevertheless , I was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy . 
But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke . 
I made no plans in the street .
