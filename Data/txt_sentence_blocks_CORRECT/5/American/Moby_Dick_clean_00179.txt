For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then . 
I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord 's policy of insurance . 
I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend . 
With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke , illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp . 
Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , I know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , I begged him to go on and tell it .
