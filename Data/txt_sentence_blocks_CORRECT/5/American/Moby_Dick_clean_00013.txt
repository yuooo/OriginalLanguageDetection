I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them . 
For my part , I abominate all honorable respectable toils , trials , and tribulations of every kind whatsoever . 
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not . 
And as for going as cook , -- though I confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board -- yet , somehow , I never fancied broiling fowls ; -- though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than I will . 
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse , that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids .
