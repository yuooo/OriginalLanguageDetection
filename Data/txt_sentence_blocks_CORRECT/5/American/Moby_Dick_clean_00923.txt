But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however lightning-like in his movements , to pitch the second iron into him .

Tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line -LRB- mentioned in a preceding chapter -RRB- making this feat , in most instances , prudently practicable . 
But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties .
