The next time it come I see I war n't heading for it , but heading away to the right of it . 
And the next time I was heading away to the left of it -- and not gaining on it much either , for I was flying around , this way and that and t ` other , but it was going straight ahead all the time . 
I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan , and beat it all the time , but he never did , and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me . 
Well , I fought along , and directly I hears the whoop BEHIND me . 
I was tangled good now .
