do not bow and look surprised : you know the proverb all along this coast -- `` Corrupt as Lima . '' 
It but bears out your saying , too ; churches more plentiful than billiard-tables , and for ever open-and `` Corrupt as Lima . '' 
So , too , Venice ; I have been there ; the holy city of the blessed evangelist , St. Mark ! 
-- St. Dominic , purge it ! 
Your cup !
