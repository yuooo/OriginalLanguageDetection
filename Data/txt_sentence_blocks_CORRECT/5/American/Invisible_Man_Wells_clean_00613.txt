That afternoon it seemed all disappointment . 
I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable . 
No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them , but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got . 
Ambition -- what is the good of pride of place when you can not appear there ? 
What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be Delilah ?
