Of all divers , thou hast dived the deepest . 
That head upon which the upper sun now gleams , has moved amid this world 's foundations . 
Where unrecorded names and navies rust , and untold hopes and anchors rot ; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned ; there , in that awful water-land , there was thy most familiar home . 
Thou hast been where bell or diver never went ; hast slept by many a sailor 's side , where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down . 
Thou saw ` st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship ; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave ; true to each other , when heaven seemed false to them .
