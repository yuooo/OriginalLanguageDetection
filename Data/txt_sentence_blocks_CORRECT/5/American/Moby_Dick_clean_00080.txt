All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner . 
At last extinguishing the fire , he took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock . 
All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness , and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations , and jumping into bed with me , I thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which I had so long been bound . 
But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say , was a fatal one . 
Taking up his tomahawk from the table , he examined the head of it for an instant , and then holding it to the light , with his mouth at the handle , he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke .
