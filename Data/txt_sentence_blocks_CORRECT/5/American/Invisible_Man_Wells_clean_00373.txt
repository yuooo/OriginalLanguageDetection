Apparently some subconscious element was at work . 
At any rate , he turned with his burden , went back to the hall , put down the syphon and whiskey , and bending down , touched the spot . 
Without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying blood . 
He took up his burden again , and returned upstairs , looking about him and trying to account for the blood-spot . 
On the landing he saw something and stopped astonished .
