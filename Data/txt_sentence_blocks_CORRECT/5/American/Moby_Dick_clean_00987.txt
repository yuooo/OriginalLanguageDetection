Remember , also , that the surgeon must operate from above , some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject , and that subject almost hidden in a discolored , rolling , and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea . 
Bear in mind , too , that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh ; and in that subterraneous manner , without so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made , he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent , interdicted parts , and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull . 
Do you not marvel , then , at Stubb 's boast , that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale ? 
When first severed , the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped . 
That done , if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of .
