Here 's a govment that calls itself a govment , and lets on to be a govment , and thinks it is a govment , and yet 's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling , thieving , infernal , white-shirted free nigger , and -- '' Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to , so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins , and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language -- mostly hove at the nigger and the govment , though he give the tub some , too , all along , here and there . 
He hopped around the cabin considerable , first on one leg and then on the other , holding first one shin and then the other one , and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick . 
But it war n't good judgment , because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it ; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body 's hair raise , and down he went in the dirt , and rolled there , and held his toes ; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous . 
He said so his own self afterwards . 
He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days , and he said it laid over him , too ; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on , maybe .
