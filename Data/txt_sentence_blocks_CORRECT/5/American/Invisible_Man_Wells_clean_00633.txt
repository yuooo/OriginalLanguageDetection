This invisibility , in fact , is only good in two cases : It 's useful in getting away , it 's useful in approaching . 
It 's particularly useful , therefore , in killing . 
I can walk round a man , whatever weapon he has , choose my point , strike as I like . 
Dodge as I like . 
Escape as I like . ''
