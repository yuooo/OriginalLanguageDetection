Tom said so himself . 
Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that 's always getting into bread , you know ; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first . 
And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light , here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim 's bed ; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them , and there war n't hardly room in there to get your breath . 
By jings , we forgot to fasten that lean-to door ! 
The nigger Nat he only just hollered `` Witches '' once , and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs , and begun to groan like he was dying .
