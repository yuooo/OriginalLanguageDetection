When close to the whale , in the very death-lock of the fight , he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly , as a whistling tinker his hammer . 
He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster . 
Long usage had , for this Stubb , converted the jaws of death into an easy chair . 
What he thought of death itself , there is no telling . 
Whether he ever thought of it at all , might be a question ; but , if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner , no doubt , like a good sailor , he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft , and bestir themselves there , about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order , and not sooner .
