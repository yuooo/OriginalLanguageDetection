Look at him ; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat ; wrapt in fleecy foam , the towing whale is forty feet ahead . 
Handling the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest unobstructed . 
Then holding the lance full before his waistband 's middle , he levels it at the whale ; when , covering him with it , he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand , thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm , fifteen feet in the air . 
He minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his chin . 
Next moment with a rapid , nameless impulse , in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance , and quivers in the life spot of the whale .
