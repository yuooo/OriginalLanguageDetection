And then one by one they got up and stood , and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful , the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight , with their heads bobbing and skimming along , away up there under the tent-roof , and every lady 's rose - leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips , and she looking like the most loveliest parasol . 
And then faster and faster they went , all of them dancing , first one foot out in the air and then the other , the horses leaning more and more , and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole , cracking his whip and shouting `` Hi ! 
-- hi ! '' 
and the clown cracking jokes behind him ; and by and by all hands dropped the reins , and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms , and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves ! 
And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring , and made the sweetest bow I ever see , and then scampered out , and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild .
