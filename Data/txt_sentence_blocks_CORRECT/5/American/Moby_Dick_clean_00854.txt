The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface , scarcely drawing one inch of water . 
It has a sort of howdah on its back , and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling , might be taken for the Traitors ' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower . 
Then , there are the Prodromus whales of the old Scotch Sibbald , and Jonah 's whale , as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers . 
What shall be said of these ? 
As for the book-binder 's whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor -- as stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and new -- that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature , imitated , I take it , from the like figures on antique vases .
