And as when Spring and Summer had departed , that wild Logan of the woods , burying himself in the hollow of a tree , lived out the winter there , sucking his own paws ; so , in his inclement , howling old age , Ahab 's soul , shut up in the caved trunk of his body , there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom ! 
The Mast-Head It was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came round . 
In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel 's leaving her port ; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles , and more , to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground . 
And if , after a three , four , or five years ' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her -- say , an empty vial even -- then , her mast-heads are kept manned to the last ! 
and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port , does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more .
