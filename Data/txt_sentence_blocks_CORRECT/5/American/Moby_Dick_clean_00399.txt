No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores , where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores . 
In like manner , the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London , put in at the Shetland Islands , to receive the full complement of their crew . 
Upon the passage homewards , they drop them there again . 
How it is , there is no telling , but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen . 
They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod , Isolatoes too , I call such , not acknowledging the common continent of men , but each Isolato living on a separate continent of his own .
