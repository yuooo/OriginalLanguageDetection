I have seen Owen Chace , who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy ; I have read his plain and faithful narrative ; I have conversed with his son ; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe . 
* * The following are extracts from Chace 's narrative : `` Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of this catastrophe I have never chanced to their direction , were calculated to do us the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it . 
Thirdly : Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J -- then commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class , happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains , on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu , Sandwich Islands . 
Conversation turning upon whales , the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present . 
He peremptorily denied for example , that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful .
