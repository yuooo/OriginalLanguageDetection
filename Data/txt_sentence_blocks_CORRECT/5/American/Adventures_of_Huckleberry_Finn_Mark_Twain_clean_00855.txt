And he said if he war n't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right , and we was to come along . 
So we stayed where we was . 
The duke he fretted and sweated around , and was in a mighty sour way . 
He scolded us for everything , and we could n't seem to do nothing right ; he found fault with every little thing . 
Something was a-brewing , sure .
