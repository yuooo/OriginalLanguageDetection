I wonder , Flask , whether the world is anchored anywhere ; if she is , she swings with an uncommon long cable , though . 
There , hammer that knot down , and we 've done . 
So ; next to touching land , lighting on deck is the most satisfactory . 
I say , just wring out my jacket skirts , will ye ? 
Thank ye .
