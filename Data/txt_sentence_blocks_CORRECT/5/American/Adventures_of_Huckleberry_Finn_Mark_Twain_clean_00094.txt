Next day he was drunk , and he went to Judge Thatcher 's and bullyragged him , and tried to make him give up the money ; but he could n't , and then he swore he 'd make the law force him . 
The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian ; but it was a new judge that had just come , and he did n't know the old man ; so he said courts must n't interfere and separate families if they could help it ; said he 'd druther not take a child away from its father . 
So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business . 
That pleased the old man till he could n't rest . 
He said he 'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if I did n't raise some money for him .
