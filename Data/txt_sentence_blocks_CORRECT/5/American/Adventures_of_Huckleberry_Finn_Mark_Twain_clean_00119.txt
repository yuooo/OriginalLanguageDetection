After supper pap took the jug , and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens . 
That was always his word . 
I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour , and then I would steal the key , or saw myself out , one or t ` other . 
He drank and drank , and tumbled down on his blankets by and by ; but luck did n't run my way . 
He did n't go sound asleep , but was uneasy .
