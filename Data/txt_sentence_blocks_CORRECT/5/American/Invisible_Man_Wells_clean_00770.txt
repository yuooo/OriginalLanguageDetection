The landlord sits down in an armchair , fills a long clay pipe slowly -- gloating over the books the while . 
Then he pulls one towards him and opens it , and begins to study it -- turning over the leaves backwards and forwards . 
His brows are knit and his lips move painfully . 
`` Hex , little two up in the air , cross and a fiddle-de-dee . 
Lord !
