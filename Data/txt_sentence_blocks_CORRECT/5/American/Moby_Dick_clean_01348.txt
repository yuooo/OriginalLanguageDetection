It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things . 
On its round border it bore the letters , REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR : QUITO . 
So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world , and beneath the great equator , and named after it ; and it had been cast midway up the Andes , in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn . 
Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes ' summits ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ; on the third a crowing cock ; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac , the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics , and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra . 
Before this equatorial coin , Ahab , not unobserved by others , was now pausing .
