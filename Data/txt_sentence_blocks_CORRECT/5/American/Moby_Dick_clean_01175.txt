Now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air , ere descending for good ? 
How obvious it is it , too , that this necessity for the whale 's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase . 
For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight . 
Not so much thy skill , then , O hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee ! 
In man , breathing is incessantly going on -- one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will .
