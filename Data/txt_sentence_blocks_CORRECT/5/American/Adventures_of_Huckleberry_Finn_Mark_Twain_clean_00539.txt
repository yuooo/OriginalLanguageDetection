Says I : `` Goodness sakes ! 
would a runaway nigger run SOUTH ? '' 
No , they allowed he would n't . 
I had to account for things some way , so I says : `` My folks was living in Pike County , in Missouri , where I was born , and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike . 
Pa , he ` lowed he 'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben , who 's got a little one - horse place on the river , forty-four mile below Orleans .
