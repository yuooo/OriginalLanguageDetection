Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet -- ` out of the belly of hell ' -- when the whale grounded upon the ocean 's utmost bones , even then , God heard the engulphed , repenting prophet when he cried . 
Then God spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea , the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun , and all the delights of air and earth ; and ` vomited out Jonah upon the dry land ; ' when the word of the Lord came a second time ; and Jonah , bruised and beaten -- his ears , like two sea-shells , still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean -- Jonah did the Almighty 's bidding . 
And what was that , shipmates ? 
To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood ! 
That was it !
