As with Fedallah the day before , so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat 's broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day 's mishap . 
But when he was helped to the deck , all eyes were fastened upon him ; as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck , who had thus far been the foremost to assist him . 
His ivory leg had been snapped off , leaving but one short sharp splinter . 
`` Aye , aye , Starbuck , 't is sweet to lean sometimes , be the leaner who he will ; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has . '' 
`` The ferrule has not stood , sir , '' said the carpenter , now coming up ; I put good work into that leg . ''
