It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale 's way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful disorders seemed waning . 
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways vanished ; then , with the tapering force of his parting momentum , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake . 
Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales , were heard but not felt .
