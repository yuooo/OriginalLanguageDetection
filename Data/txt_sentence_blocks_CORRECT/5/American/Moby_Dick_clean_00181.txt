His father was a High Chief , a King ; his uncle a High Priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors . 
There was excellent blood in his veins -- royal stuff ; though sadly vitiated , I fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth . 
A Sag Harbor ship visited his father 's bay , and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands . 
But the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the King his father 's influence could prevail . 
But Queequeg vowed a vow .
