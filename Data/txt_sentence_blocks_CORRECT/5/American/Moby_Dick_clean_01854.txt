There 's the difference now between man 's old age and matter 's . 
But aye , old mast , we both grow old together ; sound in our hulls , though are we not , my ship ? 
Aye , minus a leg , that 's all . 
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way . 
I ca n't compare with it ; and I 've known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers .
