is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them ; for your Englishman is rather reserved , and your Yankee , he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself . 
Besides , the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers ; regarding the long , lean Nantucketer , with his nondescript provincialisms , as a sort of sea-peasant . 
But where this superiority in the English whaleman does really consist , it would be hard to say , seeing that the Yankees in one day , collectively , kill more whales than all the English , collectively , in ten years . 
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters , which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart ; probably , because he knows that he has a few foibles himself . 
So , then , we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea , the whalers have most reason to be sociable -- and they are so .
