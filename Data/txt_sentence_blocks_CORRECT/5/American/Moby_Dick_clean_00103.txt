Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere . 
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence . 
And not only that , but they looked embarrassed . 
Yes , here were a set of sea-dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains . 
A curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen !
