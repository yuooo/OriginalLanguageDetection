I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times , to keep from knocking the islands out of the river ; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then , or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing -- it was floating a little faster than what I was . 
Well , I seemed to be in the open river again by and by , but I could n't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres . 
I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag , maybe , and it was all up with him . 
I was good and tired , so I laid down in the canoe and said I would n't bother no more . 
I did n't want to go to sleep , of course ; but I was so sleepy I could n't help it ; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap .
