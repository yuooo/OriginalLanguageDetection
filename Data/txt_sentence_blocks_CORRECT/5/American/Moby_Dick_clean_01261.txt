But is the Queen a mermaid , to be presented with a tail ? 
An allegorical meaning may lurk here . 
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers -- the whale and the sturgeon ; both royal property under certain limitations , and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown 's ordinary revenue . 
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter ; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale , the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish , which , symbolically regarded , may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality . 
And thus there seems a reason in all things , even in law .
