He just stood up there , a - sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he war n't ever drunk in his life -- and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them . 
He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air , and altogether he shed seventeen suits . 
And , then , there he was , slim and handsome , and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw , and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum -- and finally skipped off , and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room , and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment . 
Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled , and he WAS the sickest ringmaster you ever see , I reckon . 
Why , it was one of his own men !
