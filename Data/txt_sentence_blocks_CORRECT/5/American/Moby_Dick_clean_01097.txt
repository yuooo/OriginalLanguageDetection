Physiognomically regarded , the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature . 
He has no proper nose . 
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale . 
For as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose . 
Dash the nose from Phidias 's marble Jove , and what a sorry remainder !
