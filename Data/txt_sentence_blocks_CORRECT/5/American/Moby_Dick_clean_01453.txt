The whale of to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny 's time . 
And if ever I go where Pliny is , I , a whaleman -LRB- more than he was -RRB- , will make bold to tell him so . 
Because I can not understand how it is , that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born , do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks ; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets , by the relative proportions in which they are drawn , just as plainly prove that the high-bred , stall-fed , prize cattle of Smithfield , not only equal , but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh 's fat kine ; in the face of all this , I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated . 
But still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers . 
Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships , now penetrating even through Behring 's straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts ; the moot point is , whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a havoc ; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself evaporate in the final puff .
