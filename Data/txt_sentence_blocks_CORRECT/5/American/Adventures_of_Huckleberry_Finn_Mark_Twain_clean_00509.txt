He says : `` Laws bless you , chile , I ` uz right down sho ' you 's dead agin . 
Jack 's been heah ; he say he reck 'n you 's ben shot , kase you didn ' come home no mo ' ; so I 's jes ' dis minute a startin ' de raf ' down towards de mouf er de crick , so 's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you IS dead . 
Lawsy , I 's mighty glad to git you back again , honey . '' 
I says : `` All right -- that 's mighty good ; they wo n't find me , and they 'll think I 've been killed , and floated down the river -- there 's something up there that 'll help them think so -- so do n't you lose no time , Jim , but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can . '' 
I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi .
