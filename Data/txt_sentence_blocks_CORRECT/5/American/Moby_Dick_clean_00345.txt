Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin . 
Merry Christmas At length , towards noon , upon the final dismissal of the ship 's riggers , and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf , and after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat , with her last gift -- a nightcap for Stubb , the second mate , her brother-in-law , and a spare Bible for the steward -- after all this , the two Captains , Peleg and Bildad , issued from the cabin , and turning to the chief mate , Peleg said : `` Now , Mr. Starbuck , are you sure everything is right ? 
Captain Ahab is all ready -- just spoke to him -- nothing more to be got from shore , eh ? 
Well , call all hands , then . 
Muster 'em aft here -- blast 'em ! ''
