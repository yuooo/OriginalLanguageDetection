But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops , and knowed the day was coming . 
So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire , stopping every minute or two to listen . 
But I had n't no luck somehow ; I could n't seem to find the place . 
But by and by , sure enough , I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees . 
I went for it , cautious and slow .
