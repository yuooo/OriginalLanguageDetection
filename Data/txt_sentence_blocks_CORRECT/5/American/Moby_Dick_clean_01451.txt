Whereas , we have already seen , that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale . 
And I have heard , on whalemen 's authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture . 
But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods ; may it not be , that since Adam 's time they have degenerated ? 
Assuredly , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally . 
For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk , and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length -- Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales !
