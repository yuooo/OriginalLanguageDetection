I say this continual smoking must have been one cause , at least of his peculiar disposition ; for every one knows that this earthly air , whether ashore or afloat , is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it ; and as in time of the cholera , some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths ; so , likewise , against all mortal tribulations , Stubb 's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent . 
The third mate was Flask , a native of Tisbury , in Martha 's Vineyard . 
A short , stout , ruddy young fellow , very pugnacious concerning whales , who somehow seemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him ; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him , to destroy them whenever encountered . 
So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ; that in his poor opinion , the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse , or at least water-rat , requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil . 
This ignorant , unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales ; he followed these fish for the fun of it ; and a three years ' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time .
