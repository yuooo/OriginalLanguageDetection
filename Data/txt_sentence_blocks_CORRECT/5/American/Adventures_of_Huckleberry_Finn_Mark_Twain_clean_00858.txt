Pretty soon I went out on the road , trying to think what I better do , and I run across a boy walking , and asked him if he 'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so , and he says : `` Yes . '' 
`` Whereabouts ? '' 
says I. `` Down to Silas Phelps ' place , two mile below here . 
He 's a runaway nigger , and they 've got him . 
Was you looking for him ? ''
