It occurred on the edge of a gravel pit , not two hundred yards from Lord Burdock 's lodge gate . 
Everything points to a desperate struggle -- the trampled ground , the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received , his splintered walking-stick ; but why the attack was made , save in a murderous frenzy , it is impossible to imagine . 
Indeed the theory of madness is almost unavoidable . 
Mr. Wicksteed was a man of forty-five or forty-six , steward to Lord Burdock , of inoffensive habits and appearance , the very last person in the world to provoke such a terrible antagonist . 
Against him it would seem the Invisible Man used an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence .
