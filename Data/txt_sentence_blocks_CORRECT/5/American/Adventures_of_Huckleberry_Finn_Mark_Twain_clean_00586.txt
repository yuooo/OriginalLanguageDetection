The bank was caved away under one corner of some others , and that corner was hanging over . 
People lived in them yet , but it was dangersome , because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time . 
Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer . 
Such a town as that has to be always moving back , and back , and back , because the river 's always gnawing at it . 
The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets , and more coming all the time .
