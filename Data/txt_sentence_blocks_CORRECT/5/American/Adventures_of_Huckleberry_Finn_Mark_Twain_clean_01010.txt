I scratched around amongst the old tools , and got a pickaxe and give it to him , and he took it and went to work , and never said a word . 
He was always just that particular . 
Full of principle . 
So then I got a shovel , and then we picked and shoveled , turn about , and made the fur fly . 
We stuck to it about a half an hour , which was as long as we could stand up ; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it .
