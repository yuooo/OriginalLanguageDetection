There was a song popular at that time called `` The Bogey Man '' . 
Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert -LRB- in aid of the church lamps -RRB- , and thereafter whenever one or two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared , a bar or so of this tune , more or less sharp or flat , was whistled in the midst of them . 
Also belated little children would call `` Bogey Man ! '' 
after him , and make off tremulously elated .
