He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it . 
There war n't no frivolishness about him , not a bit , and he war n't ever loud . 
He was as kind as he could be -- you could feel that , you know , and so you had confidence . 
Sometimes he smiled , and it was good to see ; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole , and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows , you wanted to climb a tree first , and find out what the matter was afterwards . 
He did n't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners -- everybody was always good-mannered where he was .
