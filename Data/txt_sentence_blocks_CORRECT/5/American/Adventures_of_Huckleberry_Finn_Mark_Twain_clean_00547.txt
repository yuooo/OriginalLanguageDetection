I took the watch , and Jim he laid down and snored away ; and by and by the storm let up for good and all ; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him out , and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day . 
The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast , and him and the duke played seven-up a while , five cents a game . 
Then they got tired of it , and allowed they would `` lay out a campaign , '' as they called it . 
The duke went down into his carpet-bag , and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud . 
One bill said , `` The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban , of Paris , '' would `` lecture on the Science of Phrenology '' at such and such a place , on the blank day of blank , at ten cents admission , and `` furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece . ''
