I went up the bank about fifty yards , and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was , a good piece below the house . 
I jumped in , and was off in a hurry . 
I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island , and then started across . 
I took off the sun - bonnet , for I did n't want no blinders on then . 
When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike , so I stops and listens ; the sound come faint over the water but clear -- eleven .
