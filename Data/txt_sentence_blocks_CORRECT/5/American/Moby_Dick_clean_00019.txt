But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the Fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else . 
And , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago . 
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances . 
I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this : `` Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States . 
`` WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL . ''
