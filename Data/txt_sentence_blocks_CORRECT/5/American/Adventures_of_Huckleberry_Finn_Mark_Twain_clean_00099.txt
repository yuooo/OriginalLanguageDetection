He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me , but I went to school just the same , and dodged him or outrun him most of the time . 
I did n't want to go to school much before , but I reckoned I 'd go now to spite pap . 
That law trial was a slow business -- appeared like they war n't ever going to get started on it ; so every now and then I 'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him , to keep from getting a cowhiding . 
Every time he got money he got drunk ; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town ; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed . 
He was just suited -- this kind of thing was right in his line .
