He complied , and then proceeded to wash himself . 
At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face ; but Queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands . 
He then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face . 
I was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks . 
Thinks I , Queequeg , this is using Rogers 's best cutlery with a vengeance .
