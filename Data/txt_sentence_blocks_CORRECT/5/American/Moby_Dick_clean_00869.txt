Thus , the fore-ground is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable artistic contrast , is the glassy level of a sea becalmed , the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship , and the inert mass of a dead whale , a conquered fortress , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole . 
Who Garnery the painter is , or was , I know not .
