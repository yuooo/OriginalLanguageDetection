The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates -- the infant real duke was ignored . 
I am the lineal descendant of that infant -- I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater ; and here am I , forlorn , torn from my high estate , hunted of men , despised by the cold world , ragged , worn , heart-broken , and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft ! '' 
Jim pitied him ever so much , and so did I . 
We tried to comfort him , but he said it war n't much use , he could n't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how . 
He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say `` Your Grace , '' or `` My Lord , '' or `` Your Lordship '' -- and he would n't mind it if we called him plain `` Bridgewater , '' which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done .
