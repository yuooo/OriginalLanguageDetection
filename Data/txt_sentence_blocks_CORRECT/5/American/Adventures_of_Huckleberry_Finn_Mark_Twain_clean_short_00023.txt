Jim was monstrous proud about it , and he got so he would n't hardly notice the other niggers . 
Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it , and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country . 
Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over , same as if he was a wonder . 
Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire ; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things , Jim would happen in and say , `` Hm ! 
What you know ` bout witches ? ''
