I had not expected the suffering . 
A night of racking anguish , sickness and fainting . 
I set my teeth , though my skin was presently afire , all my body afire ; but I lay there like grim death . 
I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I chloroformed it . 
Lucky it was I lived alone and untended in my room .
