I know you clear through was born and raised in the South , and I 've lived in the North ; so I know the average all around . 
The average man 's a coward . 
In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to , and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it . 
In the South one man all by himself , has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime , and robbed the lot . 
Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people -- whereas you 're just AS brave , and no braver .
