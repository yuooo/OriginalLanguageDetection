While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up , and went to ripping again . 
He had been drunk over in town , and laid in the gutter all night , and he was a sight to look at . 
A body would a thought he was Adam -- he was just all mud . 
Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment , this time he says : `` Call this a govment ! 
why , just look at it and see what it 's like .
