It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver ; and , by their soft , suffusing seethings , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a solitude ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow . 
Lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea . 
Fedallah first descried this jet . 
For of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head , and stand a look-out there , with the same precision as if it had been day . 
And yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them .
