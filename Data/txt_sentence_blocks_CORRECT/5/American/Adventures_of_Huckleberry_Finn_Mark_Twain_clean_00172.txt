By and by I says to myself , I ca n't live this way ; I 'm a - going to find out who it is that 's here on the island with me ; I 'll find it out or bust . 
Well , I felt better right off . 
So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two , and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows . 
The moon was shining , and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day . 
I poked along well on to an hour , everything still as rocks and sound asleep .
