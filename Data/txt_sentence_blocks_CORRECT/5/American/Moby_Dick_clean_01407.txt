That ship -- well called the `` Syren '' -- made a noble experimental cruise ; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known . 
The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin , a Nantucketer . 
All honor to the Enderbies , therefore , whose house , I think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world . 
The ship named after him was worthy of the honor , being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way . 
I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast , and drank good flip down in the forecastle .
