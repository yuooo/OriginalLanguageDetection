By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people . 
BY and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars . 
We had n't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives . 
The seegars was prime . 
We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time .
