The verdict of the cab-rank was that he had had some sort of stroke . 
I was so unnerved by this encounter that I went into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets , panting and trembling . 
I found I had caught a fresh cold , and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention . 
`` At last I reached the object of my quest , a dirty , fly-blown little shop in a by-way near Drury Lane , with a window full of tinsel robes , sham jewels , wigs , slippers , dominoes and theatrical photographs . 
The shop was old-fashioned and low and dark , and the house rose above it for four storeys , dark and dismal .
