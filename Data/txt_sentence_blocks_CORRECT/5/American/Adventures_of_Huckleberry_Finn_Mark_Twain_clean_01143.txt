Somebody says : `` Well , it sounds very good , doctor , I 'm obleeged to say . '' 
Then the others softened up a little , too , and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn ; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him , too ; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him . 
Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well , and was deserving to have some notice took of it , and reward . 
So every one of them promised , right out and hearty , that they would n't cuss him no more . 
Then they come out and locked him up .
