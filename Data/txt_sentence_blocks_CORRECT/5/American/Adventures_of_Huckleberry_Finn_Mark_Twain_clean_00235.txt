Jim said he 'd had it there a long time , to coat it over so and make a ball of it . 
It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi , I reckon . 
Jim said he had n't ever seen a bigger one . 
He would a been worth a good deal over at the village . 
They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there ; everybody buys some of him ; his meat 's as white as snow and makes a good fry .
