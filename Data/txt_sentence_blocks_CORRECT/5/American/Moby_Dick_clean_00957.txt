It is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France , and commanded large prices there . 
Also , that in Henry VIIIth 's time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale . 
Porpoises , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating . 
The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls , and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls . 
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them .
