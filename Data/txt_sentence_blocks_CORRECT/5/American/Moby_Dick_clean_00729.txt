The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled , as it were , like the air over intensely heated plates of iron . 
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling , and partially beneath a thin layer of water , also , the whales were swimming . 
Seen in advance of all the other indications , the puffs of vapor they spouted , seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders . 
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air . 
But it bade far to outstrip them ; it flew on and on , as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills .
