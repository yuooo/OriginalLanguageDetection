All men live enveloped in whale-lines . 
All are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , everpresent perils of life . 
And if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale-boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side . 
Stubb Kills a Whale If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents , to Queequeg it was quite a different object . 
`` When you see him ` quid , '' said the savage , honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat , `` then you quick see him ` parm whale . ''
