That blubber is something of the consistence of firm , close-grained beef , but tougher , more elastic and compact , and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness . 
Now , however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature 's skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness , yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption ; because you can not raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale 's body but that same blubber ; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal , if reasonably dense , what can that be but the skin ? 
True , from the unmarred dead body of the whale , you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin , transparent substance , somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass , only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin ; that is , previous to being dried , when it not only contracts and thickens , but becomes rather hard and brittle . 
I have several such dried bits , which I use for marks in my whale-books . 
It is transparent , as I said before ; and being laid upon the printed page , I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence .
