It was an admirable artistic exploit , rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day ; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart . 
And let no man doubt this Arkite story ; for in the ancient Joppa , now Jaffa , on the Syrian coast , in one of the Pagan temples , there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale , which the city 's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew . 
When the Romans took Joppa , the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph . 
What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story , is this : it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail . 
Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda -- indeed , by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it -- is that famous story of St. George and the Dragon ; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale ; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together , and often stand for each other .
