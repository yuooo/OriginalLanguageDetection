The ringmaster could n't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said ; and how he ever COULD think of so many of them , and so sudden and so pat , was what I could n't noway understand . 
Why , I could n't a thought of them in a year . 
And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring -- said he wanted to ride ; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was . 
They argued and tried to keep him out , but he would n't listen , and the whole show come to a standstill .
