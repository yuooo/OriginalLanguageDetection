So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam , to see what the beds was like . 
My bed was a straw tick better than Jim 's , which was a corn-shuck tick ; there 's always cobs around about in a shuck tick , and they poke into you and hurt ; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves ; it makes such a rustling that you wake up . 
Well , the duke allowed he would take my bed ; but the king allowed he would n't . 
He says : `` I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed war n't just fitten for me to sleep on . 
Your Grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself . ''
