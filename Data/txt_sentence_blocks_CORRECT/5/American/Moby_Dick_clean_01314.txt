Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale 's vocabulary . 
But as applied by whalemen , it becomes so . 
A whaleman 's nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan 's tail : it averages an inch in thickness , and for the rest , is about the size of the iron part of a hoe . 
Edgewise moved along the oily deck , it operates like a leathern squilgee ; and by nameless blandishments , as of magic , allures along with it all impurities . 
But to learn all about these recondite matters , your best way is at once to descend into the blubber-room , and have a long talk with its inmates .
