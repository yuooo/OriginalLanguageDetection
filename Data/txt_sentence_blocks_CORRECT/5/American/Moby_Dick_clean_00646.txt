Or , to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance , purely addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe , does `` the tall pale man '' of the Hartz forests , whose changeless pallor unrestingly glides through the green of the groves -- why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg ? 
Nor is it , altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched cope-stones , and crosses all adroop -LRB- like canted yards of anchored fleets -RRB- ; and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of cards ; -- it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima , the strangest , saddest city thou can ` st see . 
For Lima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe . 
Old as Pizarro , this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new ; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions . 
I know that , to the common apprehension , this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible ; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon , especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality .
