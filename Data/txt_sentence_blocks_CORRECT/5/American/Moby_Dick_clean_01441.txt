But when Leviathan is the text , the case is altered . 
Fain am I to stagger to this enterprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary . 
And here be it said , that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations , I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson , expressly purchased for that purpose ; because that famous lexicographer 's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me . 
One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one . 
How , then , with me , writing of this Leviathan ?
