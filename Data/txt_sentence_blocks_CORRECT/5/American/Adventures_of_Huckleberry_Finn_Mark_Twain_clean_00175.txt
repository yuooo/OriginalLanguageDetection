By and by I was close enough to have a look , and there laid a man on the ground . 
It most give me the fantods . 
He had a blanket around his head , and his head was nearly in the fire . 
I set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him , and kept my eyes on him steady . 
It was getting gray daylight now .
