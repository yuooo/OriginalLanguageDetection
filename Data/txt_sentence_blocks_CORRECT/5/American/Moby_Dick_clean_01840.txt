How the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to . 
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells , and wards of hospitals , and ventilated them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces . 
Out upon it ! 
-- it 's tainted . 
Were I the wind , I 'd blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world .
