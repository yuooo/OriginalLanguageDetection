After breakfast we all laid off and talked , and the first thing that come out was that these chaps did n't know one another . 
`` What got you into trouble ? ''

`` Well , I 'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth -- and it does take it off , too , and generly the enamel along with it -- but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to , and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town , and you told me they were coming , and begged me to help you to get off .
