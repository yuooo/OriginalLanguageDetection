Saw a live tree , and you do n't get this dust ; amputate a live bone , and you do n't get it -LRB- sneezes -RRB- . 
Come , come , you old Smut , there , bear a hand , and let 's have that ferrule and buckle-screw ; I 'll be ready for them presently . 
Lucky now -LRB- sneezes -RRB- there 's no knee-joint to make ; that might puzzle a little ; but a mere shin-bone -- why it 's easy as making hop-poles ; only I should like to put a good finish on . 
Time , time ; if I but only had the time , I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever -LRB- sneezes -RRB- scraped to a lady in a parlor . 
Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I 've seen in shop windows would n't compare at all .
