They done it , and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead , and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off , shouting . 
We heard them come along towards the crick , but could n't see them ; they seemed to stop and fool around a while ; then , as we got further and further away all the time , we could n't hardly hear them at all ; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river , everything was quiet , and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe . 
One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards , and had a bald head and very gray whiskers . 
He had an old battered-up slouch hat on , and a greasy blue woollen shirt , and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops , and home-knit galluses -- no , he only had one . 
He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm , and both of them had big , fat , ratty-looking carpet-bags .
