Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar , when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls , nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun , and the white spray heaving high against it ; straightway the whale 's unharming corpse , with trembling fingers is set down in the log -- shoals , rocks , and breakers hereabouts : beware ! 
And for years afterwards , perhaps , ships shun the place ; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum , because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held . 
There 's your law of precedents ; there 's your utility of traditions ; there 's the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth , and now not even hovering in the air ! 
There 's orthodoxy ! 
Thus , while in the life the great whale 's body may have been a real terror to his foes , in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world .
