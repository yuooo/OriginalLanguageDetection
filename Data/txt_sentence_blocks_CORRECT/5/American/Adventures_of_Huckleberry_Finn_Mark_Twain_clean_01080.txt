He said they was made that way for some reason or other . 
We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way , and she allowed these lickings war n't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them . 
I did n't mind the lickings , because they did n't amount to nothing ; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot . 
But we got them laid in , and all the other things ; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim 's was when they 'd all swarm out for music and go for him . 
Jim did n't like the spiders , and the spiders did n't like Jim ; and so they 'd lay for him , and make it mighty warm for him .
