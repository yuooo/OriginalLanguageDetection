Stubb 's Supper Stubb 's whale had been killed some distance from the ship . 
It was a calm ; so , forming a tandem of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod . 
And now , as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved . 
For , upon the great canal of Hang-Ho , or whatever they call it , in China , four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with piglead in bulk . 
Darkness came on ; but three lights up and down in the Pequod 's main-rigging dimly guided our way ; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks .
