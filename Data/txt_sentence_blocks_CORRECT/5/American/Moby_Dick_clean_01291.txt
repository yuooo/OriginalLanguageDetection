But all this is quite different from a South Sea Sperm Whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless . 
The truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company , by the nose . 
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air . 
I say , that the motion of a Sperm Whale 's flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor . 
What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance , considering his magnitude ?
