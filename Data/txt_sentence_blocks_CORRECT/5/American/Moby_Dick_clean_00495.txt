It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy , the sole historian of Nantucket , stands accountable . 
The worthy Obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast , to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house . 
A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach . 
But this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the one proper mast-head , that of a whale-ship at sea . 
The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set ; the seamen taking their regular turns -LRB- as at the helm -RRB- , and relieving each other every two hours .
