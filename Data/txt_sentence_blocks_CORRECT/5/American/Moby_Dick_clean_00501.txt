And let me in this place movingly admonish you , ye ship-owners of Nantucket ! 
Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head . 
Beware of such an one , I say : your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one pint of sperm the richer . 
Nor are these monitions at all unneeded . 
For nowadays , the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic , melancholy , and absent-minded young men , disgusted with the corking care of earth , and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber .
