At the base of the main-mast , full beneath the doubloon and the flame , the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab 's front , but with his head bowed away from him ; while near by , from the arched and overhanging rigging , where they had just been engaged securing a spar , a number of the seamen , arrested by the glare , now cohered together , and hung pendulous , like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping , orchard twig . 
In various enchanted attitudes like the standing , or stepping , or running skeletons in Herculaneum , others remained rooted to the deck ; but all their eyes upcast . 
`` Aye , aye , men ! '' 
cried Ahab .
