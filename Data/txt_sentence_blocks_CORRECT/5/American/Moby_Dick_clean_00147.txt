That ship , my friends , was the first of recorded smugglers ! 
the contraband was Jonah . 
But the sea rebels ; he will not bear the wicked burden . 
A dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break . 
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah 's head ; in all this raging tumult , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep .
