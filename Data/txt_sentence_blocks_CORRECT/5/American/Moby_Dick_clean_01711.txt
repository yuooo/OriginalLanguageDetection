Now , as it shortly turned out , what made this incident of the Rachel 's the more melancholy , was the circumstance , that not only was one of the Captain 's sons among the number of the missing boat 's crew ; but among the number of the other boats ' crews , at the same time , but on the other hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity ; which was only solved for him by his chief mate 's instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whaleship in such emergencies , that is , when placed between jeopardized but divided boats , always to pick up the majority first .
