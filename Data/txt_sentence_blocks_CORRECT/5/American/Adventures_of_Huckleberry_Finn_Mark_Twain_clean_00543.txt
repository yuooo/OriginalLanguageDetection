Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute , being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them ; so we was pretty glad when the duke says : '' 'T is my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression . 
Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit ; I yield , I submit ; 't is my fate . 
I am alone in the world -- let me suffer ; can bear it . '' 
We got away as soon as it was good and dark . 
The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river , and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town .
