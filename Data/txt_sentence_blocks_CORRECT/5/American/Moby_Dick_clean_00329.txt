`` There are some sailors running ahead there , if I see right , '' said I to Queequeg , `` it ca n't be shadows ; she 's off by sunrise , I guess ; come on ! '' 
`` Avast ! '' 
cried a voice , whose owner at the same time coming close behind us , laid a hand upon both our shoulders , and then insinuating himself between us , stood stooping forward a little , in the uncertain twilight , strangely peering from Queequeg to me . 
It was Elijah .
