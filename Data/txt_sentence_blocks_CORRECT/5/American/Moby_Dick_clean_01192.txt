These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child 's play . 
Some one strips off a frock , and the hole is stopped . 
Third : I can not demonstrate it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant 's trunk . 
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping , when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea ; and if he feel but a sailor 's whisker , woe to that sailor , whiskers and all . 
What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch !
