I said likely we would n't , because I had heard say there war n't but about a dozen houses there , and if they did n't happen to have them lit up , how was we going to know we was passing a town ? 
Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there , that would show . 
But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again . 
That disturbed Jim -- and me too . 
So the question was , what to do ?
