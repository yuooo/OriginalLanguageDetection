Ahab must have the doubloon ! 
and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single sheaved block , to secure to the mainmast head , he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope ; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail . 
This done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo , Queequeg , Tashtego ; but shunning Fedallah ; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate , said , -- `` Take the rope , sir -- I give it into thy hands , Starbuck . '' 
Then arranging his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it . 
And thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles , -- ahead astern , this side , and that , -- within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height .
