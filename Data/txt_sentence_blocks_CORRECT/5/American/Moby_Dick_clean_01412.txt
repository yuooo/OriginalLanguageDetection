For , as a general thing , the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew ; but not so the English whaler . 
Hence , in the English , this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural , but incidental and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special origin , which is here pointed out , and will be still further elucidated . 
During my researches in the Leviathanic histories , I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume , which , by the musty whaling smell of it , I knew must be about whalers . 
The title was , `` Dan Coopman , '' wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper . 
I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one `` Fitz Swackhammer . ''
