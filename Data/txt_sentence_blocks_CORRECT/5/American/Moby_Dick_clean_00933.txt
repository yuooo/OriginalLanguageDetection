Do n't I always say that to be good , a whale-steak must be tough ? 
There are those sharks now over the side , do n't you see they prefer it tough and rare ? 
What a shindy they are kicking up ! 
Cook , go and talk to 'em ; tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly , and in moderation , but they must keep quiet . 
Blast me , if I can hear my own voice .
