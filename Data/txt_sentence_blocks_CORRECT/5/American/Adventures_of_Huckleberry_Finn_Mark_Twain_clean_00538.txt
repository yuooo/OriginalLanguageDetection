It did n't take me long to make up my mind that these liars war n't no kings nor dukes at all , but just low-down humbugs and frauds . 
But I never said nothing , never let on ; kept it to myself ; it 's the best way ; then you do n't have no quarrels , and do n't get into no trouble . 
If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , I had n't no objections , ` long as it would keep peace in the family ; and it war n't no use to tell Jim , so I did n't tell him . 
If I never learnt nothing else out of pap , I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way . 
THEY asked us considerable many questions ; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for , and laid by in the daytime instead of running -- was Jim a runaway nigger ?
