in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose . 
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick , we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind . 
A vast pulpy mass , furlongs in length and breadth , of a glancing cream-color , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms radiating from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas , as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach . 
No perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance-like apparition of life . 
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed -- `` Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost ! ''
