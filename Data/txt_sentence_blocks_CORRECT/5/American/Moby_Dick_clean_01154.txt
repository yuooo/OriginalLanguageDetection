`` Thou art as a lion of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea , '' said Ezekiel ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some versions of the Bible use that word itself . 
Besides , it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep . 
Any man may kill a snake , but only a Perseus , a St. George , a Coffin , have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale . 
Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us ; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin-like shape , and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback , yet considering the great ignorance of those times , when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists ; and considering that as in Perseus ' case , St. George 's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach ; and considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal , or sea-horse ; bearing all this in mind , it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene , to hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself . 
In fact , placed before the strict and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the Philistines , Dagon by name ; who being planted before the ark of Israel , his horse 's head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained .
