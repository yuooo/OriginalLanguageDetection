All the streets and lanes was just mud ; they war n't nothing else BUT mud -- mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places , and two or three inches deep in ALL the places . 
The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres . 
You 'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way , where folks had to walk around her , and she 'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her , and look as happy as if she was on salary . 
And pretty soon you 'd hear a loafer sing out , `` Hi ! 
SO boy !
