Again , the Right Whale has two external spout-holes , the Sperm Whale only one . 
Look your last now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following . 
Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale 's there ? 
It is the same he died with , only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away .
