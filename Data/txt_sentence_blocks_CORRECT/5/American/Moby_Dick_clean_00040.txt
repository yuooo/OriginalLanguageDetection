A still duskier place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft 's cockpits , especially of such a howling night , when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously . 
On one side stood a long , low , shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world 's remotest nooks . 
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den -- the bar -- a rude attempt at a right whale 's head . 
Be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale 's jaw , so wide , a coach might almost drive beneath it . 
Within are shabby shelves , ranged round with old decanters , bottles , flasks ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed Jonah -LRB- by which name indeed they called him -RRB- , bustles a little withered old man , who , for their money , dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death .
