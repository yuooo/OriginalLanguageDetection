It was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and eaten that very evening . 
`` No more , Queequeg , '' said I , shuddering ; `` that will do ; '' for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them . 
I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island , and he told me that it was the custom , when a great battle had been gained there , to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor ; and then , one by one , they were placed in great wooden trenchers , and garnished round like a pilau , with breadfruit and cocoanuts ; and with some parsley in their mouths , were sent round with the victor 's compliments to all his friends , just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys . 
After all , I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg . 
Because , in the first place , he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject , unless considered from his own point of view ; and , in the second place , he did not more than one third understand me , couch my ideas simply as I would ; and , finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did .
