That made me feel easy and satisfied . 
Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble , and I told Jim everything . 
WE das n't stop again at any town for days and days ; kept right along down the river . 
We was down south in the warm weather now , and a mighty long ways from home . 
We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them , hanging down from the limbs like long , gray beards .
