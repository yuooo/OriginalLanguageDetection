And before nightfall , too , a thrill of horror went through the whole watching nervous countryside . 
Going from whispering mouth to mouth , swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country , passed the story of the murder of Mr. Wicksteed . 
If our supposition that the Invisible Man 's refuge was the Hintondean thickets , then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon . 
We can not know what the project was , but the evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he met Wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming . 
Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter .
