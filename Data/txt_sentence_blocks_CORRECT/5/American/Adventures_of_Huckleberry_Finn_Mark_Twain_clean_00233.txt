He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand . 
Well , I was getting to feel that way myself , though I 've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do . 
Old Hank Bunker done it once , and bragged about it ; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower , and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer , as you may say ; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin , and buried him so , so they say , but I did n't see it . 
Pap told me . 
But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way , like a fool .
