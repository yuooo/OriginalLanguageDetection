So it was all up with Cairo . 
We talked it all over . 
It would n't do to take to the shore ; we could n't take the raft up the stream , of course . 
There war n't no way but to wait for dark , and start back in the canoe and take the chances . 
So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket , so as to be fresh for the work , and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone !
