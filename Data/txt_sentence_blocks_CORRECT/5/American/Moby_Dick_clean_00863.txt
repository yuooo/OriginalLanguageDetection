This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown . 
It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , minus only the thumb . 
This fin has four regular bone-fingers , the index , middle , ring , and little finger . 
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering . 
`` However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us , '' said humorous Stubb one day , `` he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens . ''
