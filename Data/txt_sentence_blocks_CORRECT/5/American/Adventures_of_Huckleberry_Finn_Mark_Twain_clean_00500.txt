All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store ; and that minute the two boys started on the run . 
They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed . 
Then the men see them , and jumped on their horses and took out after them . 
They gained on the boys , but it did n't do no good , the boys had too good a start ; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree , and slipped in behind it , and so they had the bulge on the men again . 
One of the boys was Buck , and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old .
