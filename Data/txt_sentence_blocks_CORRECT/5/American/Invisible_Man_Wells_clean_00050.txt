`` You wim ' do n't know everything , '' said Mr. Hall , resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity . 
And after the stranger had gone to bed , which he did about half-past nine , Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife 's furniture , just to show that the stranger was n't master there , and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left . 
When retiring for the night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger 's luggage when it came next day . 
`` You mind you own business , Hall , '' said Mrs. Hall , `` and I 'll mind mine . '' 
She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger , and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind .
