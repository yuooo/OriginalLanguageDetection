Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br -- helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying ? '' 
`` Yes , '' says somebody , `` me and Ab Turner done it . 
We 're both here . '' 
Then the old man turns towards the king , and says : `` Peraps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast ? '' 
Blamed if the king did n't have to brace up mighty quick , or he 'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under , it took him so sudden ; and , mind you , it was a thing that was calculated to make most ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice , because how was HE going to know what was tattooed on the man ?
