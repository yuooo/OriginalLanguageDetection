I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern , and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke . 
But she did n't come . 
I was in such a hurry I had n't untied her . 
I got up and tried to untie her , but I was so excited my hands shook so I could n't hardly do anything with them . 
As soon as I got started I took out after the raft , hot and heavy , right down the towhead .
