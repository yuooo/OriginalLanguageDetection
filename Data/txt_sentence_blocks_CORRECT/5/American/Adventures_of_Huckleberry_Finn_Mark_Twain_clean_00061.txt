Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly , but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes , and so that was a rest to me . 
I liked the old ways best , but I was getting so I liked the new ones , too , a little bit . 
The widow said I was coming along slow but sure , and doing very satisfactory . 
She said she war n't ashamed of me . 
One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast .
