The Invisible Man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the windows in the `` Coach and Horses , '' and then he thrust a street lamp through the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble . 
He it must have been who cut the telegraph wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins ' cottage on the Adderdean road . 
And after that , as his peculiar qualities allowed , he passed out of human perceptions altogether , and he was neither heard , seen , nor felt in Iping any more . 
He vanished absolutely . 
But it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured out again into the desolation of Iping street .
