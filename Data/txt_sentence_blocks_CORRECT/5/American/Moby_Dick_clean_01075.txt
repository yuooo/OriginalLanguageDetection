Wherefore , you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale 's head is a dead , blind wall , without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever . 
Furthermore , you are now to consider that only in the extreme , lower , backward sloping part of the front of the head , is there the slightest vestige of bone ; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development . 
So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad . 
Finally , though , as will soon be revealed , its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil ; yet , you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy . 
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange .
