It has an unspeakable , wild , Hindoo odor about it , such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres . 
It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment ; it is an argument for the pit . 
By midnight the works were in full operation . 
We were clear from the carcass ; sail had been made ; the wind was freshening ; the wild ocean darkness was intense . 
But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames , which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues , and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging , as with the famed Greek fire .
