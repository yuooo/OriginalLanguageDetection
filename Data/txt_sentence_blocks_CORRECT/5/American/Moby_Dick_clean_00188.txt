But we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs . 
I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore , and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons . 
To this , in substance , he replied , that though what I hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal combat , and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales . 
In short , like many inland reapers and mowers , who go into the farmer 's meadows armed with their own scythes -- though in no wise obliged to furnish them -- even so , Queequeg , for his own private reasons , preferred his own harpoon . 
Shifting the barrow from my hand to his , he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen .
