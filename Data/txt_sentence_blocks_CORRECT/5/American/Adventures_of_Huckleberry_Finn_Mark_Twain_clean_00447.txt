So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it . 
Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed , and I went to bed with Buck , and when I waked up in the morning , drat it all , I had forgot what my name was . 
So I laid there about an hour trying to think , and when Buck waked up I says : `` Can you spell , Buck ? '' 
`` Yes , '' he says . 
`` I bet you ca n't spell my name , '' says I. `` I bet you what you dare I can , '' says he .
