And then , presto ! 
Ahab seemed a pyramid , and I like a blazing fool , kept kicking at it . 
But what was still more curious , Flask -- you know how curious all dreams are -- through all this rage that I was in , I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself , that after all , it was not much of an insult , that kick from Ahab . 
` Why , ' thinks I , ` what 's the row ? 
It 's not a real leg , only a false one . '
