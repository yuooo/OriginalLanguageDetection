Now , by all odds , the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale 's , is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephants , in India . 
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda , all the trades and pursuits , every conceivable avocation of man , were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being . 
No wonder then , that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth . 
The Hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the Matse Avatar . 
But though this sculpture is half man and half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small section of him is all wrong .
