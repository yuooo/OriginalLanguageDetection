He had been an artisan of famed excellence , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a youthful , daughter-like , loving wife , and three blithe , ruddy children ; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church , planted in a grove . 
But one night , under cover of darkness , and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement , a desperate burglar slid into his happy home , and robbed them all of everything . 
And darker yet to tell , the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family 's heart . 
It was the Bottle Conjuror ! 
Upon the opening of that fatal cork , forth flew the fiend , and shrivelled up his home .
