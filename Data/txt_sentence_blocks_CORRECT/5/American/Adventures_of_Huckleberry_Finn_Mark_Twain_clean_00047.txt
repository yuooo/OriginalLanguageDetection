I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time , but I could n't see no advantage about it -- except for the other people ; so at last I reckoned I would n't worry about it any more , but just let it go . 
Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body 's mouth water ; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again . 
I judged I could see that there was two Providences , and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow 's Providence , but if Miss Watson 's got him there war n't no help for him any more . 
I thought it all out , and reckoned I would belong to the widow 's if he wanted me , though I could n't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before , seeing I was so ignorant , and so kind of low-down and ornery . 
Pap he had n't been seen for more than a year , and that was comfortable for me ; I did n't want to see him no more .
