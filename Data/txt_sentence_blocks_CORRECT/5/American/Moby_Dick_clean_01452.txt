And even in the days of Banks and Solander , Cooke 's naturalists , we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales -LRB- reydan-siskur , or Wrinkled Bellies -RRB- at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet . 
And Lacepede , the French naturalist , in his elaborate history of whales , in the very beginning of his work -LRB- page 3 -RRB- , sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres , three hundred and twenty-eight feet . 
And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825 . 
But will any whaleman believe these stories ? 
No .
