Human or animal , the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees . 
It signifies -- `` God : done this day by my hand . '' 
But in most creatures , nay in man himself , very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line . 
Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare 's or Melancthon 's rise so high , and descend so low , that the eyes themselves seem clear , eternal , tideless mountain lakes ; and all above them in the forehead 's wrinkles , you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink , as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer . 
But in the great Sperm Whale , this high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified , that gazing on it , in that full front view , you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature .
