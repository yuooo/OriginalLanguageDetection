I looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved . 
The greenhorn had gone down . 
Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water , Queequeg , now took an instant 's glance around him , and seeming to see just how matters were , dived down and disappeared . 
A few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form . 
The boat soon picked them up .
