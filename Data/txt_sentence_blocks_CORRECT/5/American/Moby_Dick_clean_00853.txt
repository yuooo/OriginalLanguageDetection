It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda , than the broad palms of the true whale 's majestic flukes . 
But go to the old Galleries , and look now at a great Christian painter 's portrait of this fish ; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo . 
It is Guido 's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale . 
Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that ? 
Nor does Hogarth , in painting the same scene in his own `` Perseus Descending , '' make out one whit better .
