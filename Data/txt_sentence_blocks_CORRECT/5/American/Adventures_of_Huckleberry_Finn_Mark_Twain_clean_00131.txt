But when I got to shore pap was n't in sight yet , and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully , all hung over with vines and willows , I struck another idea : I judged I 'd hide her good , and then , ` stead of taking to the woods when I run off , I 'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good , and not have such a rough time tramping on foot . 
It was pretty close to the shanty , and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time ; but I got her hid ; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows , and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun . 
So he had n't seen anything . 
When he got along I was hard at it taking up a `` trot '' line . 
He abused me a little for being so slow ; but I told him I fell in the river , and that was what made me so long .
