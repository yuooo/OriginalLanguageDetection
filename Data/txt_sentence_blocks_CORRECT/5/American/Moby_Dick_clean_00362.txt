With all her might she crowds all sail off shore ; in so doing , fights ` gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed sea 's landlessness again ; for refuge 's sake forlornly rushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe ! 
Know ye now , Bulkington ? 
Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth ; that all deep , earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea ; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous , slavish shore ? 
But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth , shoreless , indefinite as God -- so better is it to perish in that howling infinite , than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee , even if that were safety ! 
For worm-like , then , oh !
