This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah 's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me , with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of . 
But poorly could I withstand them , much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves . 
But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness -- to call it so -- which I felt , yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship , it seemed against all warranty to cherish such emotions . 
For though the harpooneers , with the great body of the crew , were a far more barbaric , heathenish , and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with , still I ascribed this -- and rightly ascribed it -- to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked . 
But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship , the mates , which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colorless misgivings , and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage .
