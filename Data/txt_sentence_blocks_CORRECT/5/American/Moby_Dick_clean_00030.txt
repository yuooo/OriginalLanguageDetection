It stood on a sharp bleak corner , where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul 's tossed craft . 
Euroclydon , nevertheless , is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors , with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed . 
In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon , '' says an old writer -- of whose works I possess the only copy extant -- `` it maketh a marvellous difference , whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside , or whether thou observest it from that sashless window , where the frost is on both sides , and of which the wight Death is the only glazier . '' 
True enough , thought I , as this passage occurred to my mind -- old black-letter , thou reasonest well . 
Yes , these eyes are windows , and this body of mine is the house .
