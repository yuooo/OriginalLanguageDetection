I am one of the gang , but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again , and will betray the helish design . 
They will sneak down from northards , along the fence , at midnight exact , with a false key , and go in the nigger 's cabin to get him . 
I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger ; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all ; then whilst they are getting his chains loose , you slip there and lock them in , and can kill them at your leasure . 
Do n't do anything but just the way I am telling you ; if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo . 
I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing .
