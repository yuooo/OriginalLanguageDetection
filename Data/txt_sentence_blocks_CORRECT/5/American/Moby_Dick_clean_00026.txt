Blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb . 
At this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted . 
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low , wide building , the door of which stood invitingly open . 
It had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch . 
Ha !
