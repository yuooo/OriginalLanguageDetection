Mr. Heelas stood up , exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things . 
He saw Kemp stand on the sill , spring from the window , and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as he ran , like a man who evades observation . 
He vanished behind a laburnum , and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down . 
In a second he had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the slope towards Mr. Heelas . 
`` Lord ! ''
