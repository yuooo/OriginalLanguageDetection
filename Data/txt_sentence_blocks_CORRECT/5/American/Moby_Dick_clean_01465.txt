Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation . 
A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings : the carpenter drills his ears . 
Another has the toothache : the carpenter out pincers , and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there ; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth . 
Thus , this carpenter was prepared at all points , and alike indifferent and without respect in all . 
Teeth he accounted bits of ivory ; heads he deemed but top-blocks ; men themselves he lightly held for capstans .
