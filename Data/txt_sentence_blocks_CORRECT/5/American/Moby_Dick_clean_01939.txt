NEW YORK , 1821 . 
`` A mariner sat in the shrouds one night , The wind was piping free ; Now bright , now dimmed , was the moonlight pale , And the phospher gleamed in the wake of the whale , As it floundered in the sea . '' 
-- ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH . 
`` The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture of this one whale , amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six English miles . 
... `` Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air , which , cracking like a whip , resounds to the distance of three or four miles . ''
