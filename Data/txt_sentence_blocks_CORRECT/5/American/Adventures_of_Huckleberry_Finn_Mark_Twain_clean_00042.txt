Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now , and when they waked him up he was scared , and cried , and said he wanted to go home to his ma , and did n't want to be a robber any more . 
So they all made fun of him , and called him cry-baby , and that made him mad , and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets . 
But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet , and said we would all go home and meet next week , and rob somebody and kill some people . 
Ben Rogers said he could n't get out much , only Sundays , and so he wanted to begin next Sunday ; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday , and that settled the thing . 
They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could , and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang , and so started home .
