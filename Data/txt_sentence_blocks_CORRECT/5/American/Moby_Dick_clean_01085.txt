By the time this cautious search is over , a stout ironbound bucket , precisely like a well-bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands . 
These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole . 
Inserting this pole into the bucket , Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun , till it entirely disappears ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all bubbling like a dairy-maid 's pail of new milk . 
Carefully lowered from its height , the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub . 
Then remounting aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more .
