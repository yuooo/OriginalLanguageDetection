Starbuck was an honest , upright man ; but out of Starbuck 's heart , at that instant when he saw the muskets , there strangely evolved an evil thought ; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself . 
`` He would have shot me once , '' he murmured , `` yes , there 's the very musket that he pointed at me ; -- that one with the studded stock ; let me touch it -- lift it . 
Strange , that I , who have handled so many deadly lances , strange , that I should shake so now . 
Loaded ? 
I must see .
