The walls of all the rooms was plastered , and most had carpets on the floors , and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside . 
It was a double house , and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored , and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day , and it was a cool , comfortable place . 
Nothing could n't be better . 
And war n't the cooking good , and just bushels of it too ! 
COL. GRANGERFORD was a gentleman , you see .
