How he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days , till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing . 
But as all else in him thinned , and his cheek-bones grew sharper , his eyes , nevertheless , seemed growing fuller and fuller ; they became of a strange softness of lustre ; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness , a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die , or be weakened . 
And like circles on the water , which , as they grow fainter , expand ; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding , like the rings of Eternity . 
An awe that can not be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage , and saw as strange things in his face , as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died . 
For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books .
