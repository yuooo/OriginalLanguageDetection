At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward 's pantry ; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate 's desk , where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one 's rheumatic back . 
Never did any woman better deserve her name , which was Charity -- Aunt Charity , as everybody called her . 
And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither , ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety , comfort , and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned , and in which she herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars . 
But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board , as she did the last day , with a long oil-ladle in one hand , and a still longer whaling lance in the other . 
Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward .
