Spite of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it . 
I confess , that once I stole behind the foremast to try it . 
It tasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted , supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season , and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne . 
There is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe . 
It is called slobgollion ; an appellation original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance .
