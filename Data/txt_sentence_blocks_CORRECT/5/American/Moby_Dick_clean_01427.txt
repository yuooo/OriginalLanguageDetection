Now , amid the green , life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood , the great , white , worshipped skeleton lay lounging -- a gigantic idler ! 
Yet , as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him , the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver ; himself all woven over with the vines ; every month assuming greener , fresher verdure ; but himself a skeleton . 
Life folded Death ; Death trellised Life ; the grim god wived with youthful Life , and begat him curly-headed glories . 
Now , when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu . 
He laughed .
