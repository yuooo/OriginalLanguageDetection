The soot is brushed from the lower rigging . 
All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away . 
The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works , completely hiding the pots ; every cask is out of sight ; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks ; and when by the combined and , simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship 's company , the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded , then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions ; shift themselves from top to toe ; and finally issue to the immaculate deck , fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland . 
Now , with elated step , they pace the planks in twos and threes , and humorously discourse of parlors , sofas , carpets , and fine cambrics ; propose to mat the deck ; think of having hangings to the top ; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle . 
To hint to such musked mariners of oil , and bone , and blubber , were little short of audacity .
