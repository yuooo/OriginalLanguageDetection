The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets , nursing at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent conquering Earls , the golden helmeted suns ! 
For sleeping man , 't was hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights . 
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world . 
Inward they turned upon the soul , especially when the still mild hours of eve came on ; then , memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights . 
And all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on Ahab 's texture .
