It may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them . 
But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye . 
If you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ . 
The ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it . 
It is lodged a little behind the eye .
