So we shortened up one of the calico gowns , and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it . 
Jim hitched it behind with the hooks , and it was a fair fit . 
I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin , and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe . 
Jim said nobody would know me , even in the daytime , hardly . 
I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things , and by and by I could do pretty well in them , only Jim said I did n't walk like a girl ; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket .
