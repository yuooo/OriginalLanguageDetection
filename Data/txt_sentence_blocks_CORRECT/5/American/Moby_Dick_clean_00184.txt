the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father 's heathens . 
Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to Nantucket , and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also , poor Queequeg gave it up for lost .

And thus an old idolator at heart , he yet lived among these Christians , wore their clothes , and tried to talk their gibberish . 
Hence the queer ways about him , though now some time from home .
