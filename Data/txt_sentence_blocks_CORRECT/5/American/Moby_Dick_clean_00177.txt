If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable , and have been so a long time , then you can not be said to be comfortable any more . 
But if , like Queequeg and me in the bed , the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm . 
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich . 
For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blankets between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air . 
Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal .
