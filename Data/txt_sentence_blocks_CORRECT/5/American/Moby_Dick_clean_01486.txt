I should humbly call it a poser , sir . 
Hist , then . 
How dost thou know that some entire , living , thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest ; aye , and standing there in thy spite ? 
In thy most solitary hours , then , dost thou not fear eavesdroppers ? 
Hold , do n't speak !
