But , aside again ! 
here comes that ghost-devil , Fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual . 
What does he say , with that look of his ? 
Ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin -- fire worshipper , depend upon it . 
Ho !
