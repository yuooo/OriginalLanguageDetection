Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away , Queequeg , to every one 's consternation , commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him , nor was there any denying him ; seeing that , of all mortals , some dying men are the most tyrannical ; and certainly , since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore , the poor fellows ought to be indulged . 
Leaning over in his hammock , Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye . 
He then called for his harpoon , had the wooden stock drawn from it , and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat . 
All by his own request , also , biscuits were then ranged round the sides within ; a flask of fresh water was placed at the head , and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot ; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow , Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed , that he might make trial of its comforts , if any it had . 
He lay without moving a few minutes , then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god , Yojo .
