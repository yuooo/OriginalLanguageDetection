Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg , and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts , and selecting one entitled `` The Latter Day Coming ; or No Time to Lose , '' placed it in Queequeg 's hands , and then grasping them and the book with both his , looked earnestly into his eyes , and said , `` Son of darkness , I must do my duty by thee ; I am part owner of this ship , and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew ; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways , which I sadly fear , I beseech thee , remain not for aye a Belial bondsman . 
Spurn the idol Bell , and the hideous dragon ; turn from the wrath to come ; mind thine eye , I say ; oh ! 
goodness gracious ! 
steer clear of the fiery pit ! '' 
Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad 's language , heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases .
