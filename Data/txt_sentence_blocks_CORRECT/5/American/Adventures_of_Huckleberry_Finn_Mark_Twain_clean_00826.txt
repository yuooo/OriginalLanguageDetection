says the old gentleman . 
`` Now , what you DID see on his breast was a small dim P , and a B -LRB- which is an initial he dropped when he was young -RRB- , and a W , with dashes between them , so : P -- B -- W '' -- and he marked them that way on a piece of paper . 
`` Come , ai n't that what you saw ? '' 
Both of them spoke up again , and says : `` No , we DID N'T . 
We never seen any marks at all . ''
