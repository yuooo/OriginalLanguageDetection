Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw ; maybe he lies and says he ai n't got none . 
Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world , nor a chaw of tobacco of their own . 
They get all their chawing by borrowing ; they say to a fellow , `` I wisht you 'd len ' me a chaw , Jack , I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had '' -- which is a lie pretty much everytime ; it do n't fool nobody but a stranger ; but Jack ai n't no stranger , so he says : `` YOU give him a chaw , did you ? 
So did your sister 's cat 's grandmother . 
You pay me back the chaws you 've awready borry 'd off 'n me , Lafe Buckner , then I 'll loan you one or two ton of it , and wo n't charge you no back intrust , nuther . ''
