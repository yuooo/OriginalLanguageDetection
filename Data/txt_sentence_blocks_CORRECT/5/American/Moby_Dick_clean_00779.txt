NOUN -- A social meeting of two -LRB- or more -RRB- Whaleships , generally on a cruising-ground ; when , after exchanging hails , they exchange visits by boats ' crews , the two captains remaining , for the time , on board of one ship , and the two chief mates on the other . 
There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here . 
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery . 
In a pirate , man-of-war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner 's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons . 
But the whale-boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all .
