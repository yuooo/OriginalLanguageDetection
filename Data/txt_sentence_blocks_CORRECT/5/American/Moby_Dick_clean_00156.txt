I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners ; and therefore to ye , and still more to me , for I am a greater sinner than ye . 
And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit , and listen as you listen , while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to me , as a pilot of the living God . 
How being an anointed pilot-prophet , or speaker of true things and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh , Jonah , appalled at the hostility he should raise , fled from his mission , and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa . 
But God is everywhere ; Tarshish he never reached . 
As we have seen , God came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom , and with swift slantings tore him along ` into the midst of the seas , ' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and ` the weeds were wrapped about his head , ' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him .
