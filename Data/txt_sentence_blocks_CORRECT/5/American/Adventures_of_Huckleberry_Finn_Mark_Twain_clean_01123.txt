I says to Sister Damrell -- did n't I , Sister Damrell ? 
-- s ` I , he 's crazy , s ` I -- them 's the very words I said . 
You all hearn me : he 's crazy , s ` I ; everything shows it , s ` I. Look at that-air grindstone , s ` I ; want to tell ME ' t any cretur ` t 's in his right mind 's a goin ' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone , s ` I ?
