He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him ; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth , like so many white bolts , upon his prison . 
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish 's belly . 
But observe his prayer , and so many white bolts , upon his prison . 
Then Jonah prayed unto learn a weighty lesson . 
For sinful as he is , Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance .
