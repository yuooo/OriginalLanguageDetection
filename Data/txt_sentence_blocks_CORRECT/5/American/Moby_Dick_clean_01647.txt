`` Thou poor , proud heaven-gazer and sun 's pilot ! 
yesterday I wrecked thee , and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me . 
So , so . 
But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet . 
Mr. Starbuck -- a lance without the pole ; a top-maul , and the smallest of the sail-maker 's needles .
