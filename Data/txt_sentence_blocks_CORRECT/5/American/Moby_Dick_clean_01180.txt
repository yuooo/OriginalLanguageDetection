My dear sir , in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things . 
I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all . 
And as for this whale spout , you might almost stand in it , and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely . 
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water cascading all around him . 
And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout , how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor ; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure , which is countersunk into the summit of the whale 's head ?
