In cavalier attendance upon the school of females , you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude , but not old ; who , upon any alarm , evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies . 
In truth , this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman , swimming about over the watery world , surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem . 
The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking ; because , while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions , the ladies , even at full growth , are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male . 
They are comparatively delicate , indeed ; I dare say , not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist . 
Nevertheless , it can not be denied , that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point .
