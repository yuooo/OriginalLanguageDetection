With respect to their ears , this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right . 
While the ears of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane , so as to be quite imperceptible from without . 
Is it not curious , that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye , and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare 's ? 
But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel 's great telescope ; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals ; would that make him any longer of sight , or sharper of hearing ? 
Not at all .
