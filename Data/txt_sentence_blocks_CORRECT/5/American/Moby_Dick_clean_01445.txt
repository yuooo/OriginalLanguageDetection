But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster , found in the year 1842 , on the plantation of Judge Creagh , in Alabama . 
The awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels . 
The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile , and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus . 
But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen , the English Anatomist , it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale , though of a departed species . 
A significant illustration of the fact , again and again repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body .
