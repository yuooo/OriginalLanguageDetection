Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up ; and had a character to lose ; and folks at home that had characters ; and he was bright and not leather-headed ; and knowing and not ignorant ; and not mean , but kind ; and yet here he was , without any more pride , or rightness , or feeling , than to stoop to this business , and make himself a shame , and his family a shame , before everybody . 
I COULD N'T understand it no way at all .
