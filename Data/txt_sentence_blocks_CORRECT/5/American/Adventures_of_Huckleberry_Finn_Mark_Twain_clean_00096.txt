The judge said he could hug him for them words ; so he cried , and his wife she cried again ; pap said he 'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before , and the judge said he believed it . 
The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy , and the judge said it was so ; so they cried again . 
And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand , and says : `` Look at it , gentlemen and ladies all ; take a-hold of it ; shake it . 
There 's a hand that was the hand of a hog ; but it ai n't so no more ; it 's the hand of a man that 's started in on a new life , and 'll die before he 'll go back . 
You mark them words -- do n't forget I said them .
