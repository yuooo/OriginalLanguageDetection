good people all , -- the Greenland whale is deposed , -- the great sperm whale now reigneth ! 
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt . 
Those books are Beale 's and Bennett 's ; both in their time surgeons to the English South-Sea whale-ships , and both exact and reliable men . 
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to scientific description . 
As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature .
