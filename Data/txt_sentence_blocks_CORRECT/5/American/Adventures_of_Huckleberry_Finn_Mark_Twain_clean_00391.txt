Conscience says to me , `` What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word ? 
What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean ? 
Why , she tried to learn you your book , she tried to learn you your manners , she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how .
