I thought it all over , and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines , and take to the woods when I run away . 
I guessed I would n't stay in one place , but just tramp right across the country , mostly night times , and hunt and fish to keep alive , and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow could n't ever find me any more . 
I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough , and I reckoned he would . 
I got so full of it I did n't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded . 
I got the things all up to the cabin , and then it was about dark .
