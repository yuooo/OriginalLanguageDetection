The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty , so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol . 
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease meantime -- to see what was next to follow . 
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp , he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze . 
Presently , after many hasty snatches into the fire , and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers -LRB- whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly -RRB- , he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro . 
But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips .
