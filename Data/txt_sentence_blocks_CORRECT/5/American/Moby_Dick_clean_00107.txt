They are mostly young , of stalwart frames ; fellows who have felled forests , and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance . 
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came . 
In some things you would think them but a few hours old . 
Look there ! 
that chap strutting round the corner .
