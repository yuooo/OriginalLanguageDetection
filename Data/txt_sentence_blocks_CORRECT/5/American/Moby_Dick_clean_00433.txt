` Very good , ' says he -- ` he used his ivory leg , did n't he ? ' 
` Yes , he did , ' says I. ` Well then , ' says he , ` wise Stubb , what have you to complain of ? 
Did n't he kick with right good will ? 
it was n't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with , was it ? 
No , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , Stubb .
