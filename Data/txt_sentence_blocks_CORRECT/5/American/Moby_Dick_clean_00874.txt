His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping , at any rate ; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings . 
But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation . 
Throughout the Pacific , and also in Nantucket , and New Bedford , and Sag Harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth , or ladies ' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone , and other like skrimshander articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure . 
Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business . 
But , in general , they toil with their jack-knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner 's fancy .
