Supper concluded , we received a lamp , and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; but , as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs , the lady reached forth her arm , and demanded his harpoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers . 
`` Why not ? 
said I ; `` every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon -- but why not ? '' 
`` Because it 's dangerous , '' says she . 
`` Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort ` nt v ` y' ge of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of ile , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night .
