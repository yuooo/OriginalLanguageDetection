In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish . 
The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn -LRB- precisely resembling two large puddings -RRB- , they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves ' head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves ' brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf 's head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination . 
And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf 's head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see . 
The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him , with an `` Et tu Brute ! '' 
expression .
