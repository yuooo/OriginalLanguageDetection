So I kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; salamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; and that done , we undressed and went to bed , at peace with our own consciences and all the world . 
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat . 
How it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends . 
Man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning . 
Thus , then , in our hearts ' honeymoon , lay I and Queequeg -- a cosy , loving pair .
