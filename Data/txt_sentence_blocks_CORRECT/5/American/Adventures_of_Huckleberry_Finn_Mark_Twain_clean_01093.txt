If a door banged , Aunt Sally she jumped and said `` ouch ! '' 
if anything fell , she jumped and said `` ouch ! '' 
if you happened to touch her , when she war n't noticing , she done the same ; she could n't face noway and be satisfied , because she allowed there was something behind her every time -- so she was always a-whirling around sudden , and saying `` ouch , '' and before she 'd got two-thirds around she 'd whirl back again , and say it again ; and she was afraid to go to bed , but she das n't set up . 
So the thing was working very well , Tom said ; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory . 
He said it showed it was done right .
