This young fellow 's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he can not have been three days landed from his Indian voyage . 
That man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him . 
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore . 
But who could show a cheek like Queequeg ? 
which , barred with various tints , seemed like the Andes ' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone .
