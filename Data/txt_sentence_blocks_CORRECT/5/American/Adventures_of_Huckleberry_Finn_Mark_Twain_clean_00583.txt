`` Well , I DID pay you back some of it wunst . '' 
`` Yes , you did -- ` bout six chaws . 
You borry 'd store tobacker and paid back nigger-head . '' 
Store tobacco is flat black plug , but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted . 
When they borrow a chaw they do n't generly cut it off with a knife , but set the plug in between their teeth , and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two ; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it 's handed back , and says , sarcastic : `` Here , gim me the CHAW , and you take the PLUG . ''
