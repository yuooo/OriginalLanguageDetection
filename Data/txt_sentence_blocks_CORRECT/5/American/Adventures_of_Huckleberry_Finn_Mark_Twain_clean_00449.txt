It was a mighty nice family , and a mighty nice house , too . 
I had n't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style . 
It did n't have an iron latch on the front door , nor a wooden one with a buckskin string , but a brass knob to turn , the same as houses in town . 
There war n't no bed in the parlor , nor a sign of a bed ; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them . 
There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom , and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick ; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown , same as they do in town .
