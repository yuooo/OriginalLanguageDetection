Oh , grassy glades ! 
oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul ; in ye , -- though long parched by the dead drought of the earthly life , -- in ye , men yet may roll , like young horses in new morning clover ; and for some few fleeting moments , feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them . 
Would to God these blessed calms would last . 
But the mingled , mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof : calms crossed by storms , a storm for every calm . 
There is no steady unretracing progress in this life ; we do not advance through fixed gradations , and at the last one pause : -- through infancy 's unconscious spell , boyhood 's thoughtless faith , adolescence ' doubt -LRB- the common doom -RRB- , then scepticism , then disbelief , resting at last in manhood 's pondering repose of If .
