In vain , oh whale , dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun , that only calls forth life , but gives it not again . 
Yet dost thou darker half , rock me with a prouder , if a darker faith . 
All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here ; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things , exhaled as air , but water now . 
`` Then hail , for ever hail , O sea , in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest . 
Born of earth , yet suckled by the sea ; though hill and valley mothered me , ye billows are my foster-brothers ! ''
