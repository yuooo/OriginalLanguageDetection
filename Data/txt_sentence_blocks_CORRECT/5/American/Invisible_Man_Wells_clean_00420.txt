The Invisible Man was silent for a space . 
`` I ca n't tell you to-night , '' he said . 
He groaned suddenly and leant forward , supporting his invisible head on invisible hands . 
`` Kemp , '' he said , `` I 've had no sleep for near three days , except a couple of dozes of an hour or so . 
I must sleep soon . ''
