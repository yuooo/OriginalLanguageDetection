For according to King Juba , the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence . 
The chance comparison in this chapter , between the whale and the elephant , so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned , should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality , much less the creatures to which they respectively belong . 
For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan , so , compared with Leviathan 's tail , his trunk is but the stalk of a lily . 
The most direful blow from the elephant 's trunk were as the playful tap of a fan , compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale 's ponderous flukes , which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air , very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls . 
* * Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous , inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant ; nevertheless , there are not wanting some points of curious similitude ; among these is the spout .
