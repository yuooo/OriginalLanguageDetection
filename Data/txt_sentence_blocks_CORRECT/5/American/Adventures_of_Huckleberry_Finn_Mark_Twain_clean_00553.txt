There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend , and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim ; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing . 
The king allowed he would go , too , and see if he could n't strike something . 
We was out of coffee , so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some . 
When we got there there war n't nobody stirring ; streets empty , and perfectly dead and still , like Sunday . 
We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard , and he said everybody that war n't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting , about two mile back in the woods .
