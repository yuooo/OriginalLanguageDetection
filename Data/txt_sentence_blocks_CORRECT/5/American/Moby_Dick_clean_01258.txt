In a word , the whale was seized and sold , and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money . 
Thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration . 
To which my Lord Duke in substance replied -LRB- both letters were published -RRB- that he had already done so , and received the money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he -LRB- the reverend gentleman -RRB- would decline meddling with other people 's business . 
Is this the still militant old man , standing at the corners of the three kingdoms , on all hands coercing alms of beggars ? 
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign .
