Now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by anticipation , was made to face the whale 's head while yet under water . 
But as if perceiving this stratagem , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat . 
Through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it thrilled for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock . 
The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab 's head , and reached higher than that . 
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse .
