It had been thus with the Pequod . 
The wooden reel and angular log attached hung , long untouched , just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks . 
Rains and spray had damped it ; the sun and wind had warped it ; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly . 
But heedless of all this , his mood seized Ahab , as he happened to glance upon the reel , not many hours after the magnet scene , and he remembered how his quadrant was no more , and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line . 
The ship was sailing plungingly ; astern the billows rolled in riots .
