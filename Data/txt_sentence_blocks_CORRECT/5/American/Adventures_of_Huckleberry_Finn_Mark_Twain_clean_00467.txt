Each person had their own nigger to wait on them -- Buck too . 
My nigger had a monstrous easy time , because I war n't used to having anybody do anything for me , but Buck 's was on the jump most of the time . 
This was all there was of the family now , but there used to be more -- three sons ; they got killed ; and Emmeline that died . 
The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers . 
Sometimes a stack of people would come there , horseback , from ten or fifteen mile around , and stay five or six days , and have such junketings round about and on the river , and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes , and balls at the house nights .
