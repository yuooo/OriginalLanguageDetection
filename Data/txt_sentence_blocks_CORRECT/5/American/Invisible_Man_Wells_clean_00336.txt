Dr. Kemp 's solar lamp was lit , albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light , and his blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down . 
Dr. Kemp was a tall and slender young man , with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white , and the work he was upon would earn him , he hoped , the fellowship of the Royal Society , so highly did he think of it . 
And his eye , presently wandering from his work , caught the sunset blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own . 
For a minute perhaps he sat , pen in mouth , admiring the rich golden colour above the crest , and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man , inky black , running over the hill-brow towards him . 
He was a shortish little man , and he wore a high hat , and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled .
