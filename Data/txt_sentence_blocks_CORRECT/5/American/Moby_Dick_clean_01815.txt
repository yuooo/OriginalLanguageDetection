Ahab 's boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them he would take the whale head-and-head , -- that is , pull straight up to his forehead , -- a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale 's sidelong vision . 
But ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship 's three masts to his eye ; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made . 
But skilfully manoeuvred , incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field ; the boats for a while eluded him ; though , at times , but by a plank 's breadth ; while all the time , Ahab 's unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds . 
But at last in his untraceable evolutions , the White Whale so crossed and recrossed , and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him , that they foreshortened , and , of themselves , warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to rally for a more tremendous charge . 
Seizing that opportunity , Ahab first paid out more line ; and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again -- hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls -- when lo !
