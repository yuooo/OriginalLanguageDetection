One thing kept Mr. Bunting 's courage ; the persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village . 
They heard the chink of money , and realised that the robber had found the housekeeping reserve of gold -- two pounds ten in half sovereigns altogether . 
At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action . 
Gripping the poker firmly , he rushed into the room , closely followed by Mrs. Bunting . 
`` Surrender ! ''
