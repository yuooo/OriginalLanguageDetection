Then we hung up our signal lantern , and judged that we was free and safe once more . 
I had n't had a bite to eat since yesterday , so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk , and pork and cabbage and greens -- there ai n't nothing in the world so good when it 's cooked right -- and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time . 
I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds , and so was Jim to get away from the swamp . 
We said there war n't no home like a raft , after all . 
Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery , but a raft do n't .
