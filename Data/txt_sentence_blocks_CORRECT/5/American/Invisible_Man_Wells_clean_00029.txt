But for a second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open -- a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face . 
It was the sensation of a moment : the white-bound head , the monstrous goggle eyes , and this huge yawn below it . 
Then he stirred , started up in his chair , put up his hand .
