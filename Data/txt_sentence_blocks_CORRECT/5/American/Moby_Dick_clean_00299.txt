Without saying a word , Queequeg , in his wild sort of way , jumped upon the bulwarks , from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side ; and then bracing his left knee , and poising his harpoon , cried out in some such way as this : -- `` Cap ` ain , you see him small drop tar on water dere ? 
You see him ? 
well , spose him one whale eye , well , den ! '' 
and taking sharp aim at it , he darted the iron right over old Bildad 's broad brim , clean across the ship 's decks , and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight . 
`` Now , '' said Queequeg , quietly , hauling in the line , `` spos-ee him whale-e eye ; why , dad whale dead . ''
