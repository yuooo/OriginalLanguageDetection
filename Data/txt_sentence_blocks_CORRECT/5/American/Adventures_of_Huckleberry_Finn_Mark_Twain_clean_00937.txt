We war n't looking for YOU at all , but only Tom . 
Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him . '' 
`` It 's because it war n't INTENDED for any of us to come but Tom , '' he says ; `` but I begged and begged , and at the last minute she let me come , too ; so , coming down the river , me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first , and for me to by and by tag along and drop in , and let on to be a stranger . 
But it was a mistake , Aunt Sally . 
This ai n't no healthy place for a stranger to come . ''
