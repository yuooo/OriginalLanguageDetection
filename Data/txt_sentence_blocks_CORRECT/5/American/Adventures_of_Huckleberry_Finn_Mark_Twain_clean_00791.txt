A body might stump his toe , and take pison , and fall down the well , and break his neck , and bust his brains out , and somebody come along and ask what killed him , and some numskull up and say , ` Why , he stumped his TOE . ' 
Would ther ' be any sense in that ? 
NO . 
And ther ' ai n't no sense in THIS , nuther . 
Is it ketching ? ''
