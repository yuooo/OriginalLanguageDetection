His hat was laying on the floor -- an old black slouch with the top caved in , like a lid . 
I stood a-looking at him ; he set there a-looking at me , with his chair tilted back a little . 
I set the candle down . 
I noticed the window was up ; so he had clumb in by the shed . 
He kept a-looking me all over .
