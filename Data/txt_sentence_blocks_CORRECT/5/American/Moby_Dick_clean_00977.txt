Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents , he not seldom displays the back , and more especially his flanks , effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance , by reason of numerous rude scratches , altogether of an irregular , random aspect . 
I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast , which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs -- I should say , that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular . 
It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales ; for I have most remarked them in the large , full-grown bulls of the species . 
A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale . 
It has already been said , that it is stript from him in long pieces , called blanket-pieces .
