They are the only whales regularly hunted by man . 
To the Nantucketer , they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale . 
As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads ; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod 's side ; and as we may freely go from one to the other , by merely stepping across the deck : -- where , I should like to know , will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here ? 
In the first place , you are struck by the general contrast between these heads . 
Both are massive enough in all conscience ; but , there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale 's which the Right Whale 's sadly lacks .
