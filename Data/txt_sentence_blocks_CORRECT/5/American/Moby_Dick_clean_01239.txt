The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools . 
Like a mob of young collegians , they are full of fight , fun , and wickedness , tumbling round the world at such a reckless , rollicking rate , that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard . 
They soon relinquish this turbulence though , and when about three-fourths grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of settlements , that is , harems . 
Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes . 
Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull -- poor devil !
