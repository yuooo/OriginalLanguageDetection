Lots of the principal people gethered around the king , to let him see they was on his side . 
That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death . 
Pretty soon he begun to speak , and I see straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman -- not the king 's way , though the king 's WAS pretty good for an imitation . 
I ca n't give the old gent 's words , nor I ca n't imitate him ; but he turned around to the crowd , and says , about like this : `` This is a surprise to me which I was n't looking for ; and I 'll acknowledge , candid and frank , I ai n't very well fixed to meet it and answer it ; for my brother and me has had misfortunes ; he 's broke his arm , and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake . 
I am Peter Wilks ' brother Harvey , and this is his brother William , which ca n't hear nor speak -- and ca n't even make signs to amount to much , now ' t he 's only got one hand to work them with .
