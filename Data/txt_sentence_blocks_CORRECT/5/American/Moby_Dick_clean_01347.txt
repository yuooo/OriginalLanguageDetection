Nor , though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands , and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach , nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset last left it last . 
For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end ; and however wanton in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners revered it as the white whale 's talisman . 
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it . 
Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic token-pieces . 
Here palms , alpacas , and volcanoes ; sun 's disks and stars , ecliptics , horns-of-plenty , and rich banners waving , are in luxuriant profusion stamped ; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories , by passing through those fancy mints , so Spanishly poetic .
