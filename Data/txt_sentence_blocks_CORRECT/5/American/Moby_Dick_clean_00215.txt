Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots , which well deserved its name ; for the pots there were always boiling chowders . 
Chowder for breakfast , and chowder for dinner , and chowder for supper , till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes . 
The area before the house was paved with clam-shells . 
Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra ; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin . 
There was a fishy flavor to the milk , too , which I could not at all account for , till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen 's boats , I saw Hosea 's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants , and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod 's decapitated head , looking very slipshod , I assure ye .
