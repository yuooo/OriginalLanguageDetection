There is some advantage in this ; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the American tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one-half inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one . 
When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line-tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales . 
Both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything . 
This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts . 
First : In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon .
