I feel strained , half-stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale ; and I may look so . 
But ere I break , yell hear me crack ; and till ye hear that , know that Ahab 's hawser tows his purpose yet . 
Believe ye , men , in the things called omens ? 
Then laugh aloud , and cry encore ! 
For ere they drown , drowning things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , to sink for evermore .
