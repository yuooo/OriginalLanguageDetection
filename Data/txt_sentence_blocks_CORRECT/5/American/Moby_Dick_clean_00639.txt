Whisper it not , and I will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea . 
At last the Captain made a postman of it ; tying a lettered , leathern tally round its neck , with the ship 's time and place ; and then letting it escape . 
But I doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim ! 
Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies ; a magnificent milk-white charger , large-eyed , small-headed , bluff-chested , and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty , overscorning carriage . 
He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses , whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies .
