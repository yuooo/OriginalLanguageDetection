Well , the night got gray and ruther thick , which is the next meanest thing to fog . 
You ca n't tell the shape of the river , and you ca n't see no distance . 
It got to be very late and still , and then along comes a steamboat up the river . 
We lit the lantern , and judged she would see it . 
Up-stream boats did n't generly come close to us ; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs ; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river .
