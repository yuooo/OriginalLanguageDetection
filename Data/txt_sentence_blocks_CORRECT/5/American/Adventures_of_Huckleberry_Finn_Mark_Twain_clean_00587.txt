Families fetched their dinners with them from the country , and eat them in the wagons . 
There was considerable whisky drinking going on , and I seen three fights . 
By and by somebody sings out : `` Here comes old Boggs ! 
-- in from the country for his little old monthly drunk ; here he comes , boys ! '' 
All the loafers looked glad ; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs .
