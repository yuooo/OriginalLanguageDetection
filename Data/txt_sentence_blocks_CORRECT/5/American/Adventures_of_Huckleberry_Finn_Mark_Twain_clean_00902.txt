But I could n't get no show , Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so . 
Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back , because she says : `` But here we 're a-running on this way , and you hai n't told me a word about Sis , nor any of them . 
Now I 'll rest my works a little , and you start up yourn ; just tell me EVERYTHING -- tell me all about 'm all every one of 'm ; and how they are , and what they 're doing , and what they told you to tell me ; and every last thing you can think of . '' 
Well , I see I was up a stump -- and up it good . 
Providence had stood by me this fur all right , but I was hard and tight aground now .
