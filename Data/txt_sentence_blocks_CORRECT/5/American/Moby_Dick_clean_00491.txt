So that , in real truth , the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it . 
For when they did enter it , it was something as a streetdoor enters a house ; turning inwards for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , residing in the open air . 
Nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially , Ahab was inaccessible . 
Though nominally included in the census of Christendom , he was still an alien to it . 
He lived in the world , as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri .
