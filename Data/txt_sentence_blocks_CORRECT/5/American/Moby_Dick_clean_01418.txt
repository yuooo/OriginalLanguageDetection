Now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat 's head , and take good aim at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat improbable . 
Yet they did aim at them , and hit them too . 
But this was very far North , be it remembered , where beer agrees well with the constitution ; upon the Equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat ; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford . 
But no more ; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers ; and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example . 
For , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least .
