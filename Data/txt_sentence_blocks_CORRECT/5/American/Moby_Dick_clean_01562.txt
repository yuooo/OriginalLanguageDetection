`` Oh , thou dark Hindoo half of nature , who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas ; thou art an infidel , thou queen , and too truly speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering Typhoon , and the hushed burial of its after calm . 
Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head , and then gone round again , without a lesson to me . 
`` Oh , trebly hooped and welded hip of power ! 
Oh , high aspiring , rainbowed jet ! 
-- that one strivest , this one jettest all in vain !
