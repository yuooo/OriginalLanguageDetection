Old Captain Peleg , many years her chief-mate , before he commanded another vessel of his own , and now a retired seaman , and one of the principal owners of the Pequod , -- this old Peleg , during the term of his chief-mateship , had built upon her original grotesqueness , and inlaid it , all over , with a quaintness both of material and device , unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake 's carved buckler or bedstead . 
She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor , his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory . 
She was a thing of trophies . 
A cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies . 
All round , her unpanelled , open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw , with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale , inserted there for pins , to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to .
