Let America add Mexico to Texas , and pile Cuba upon Canada ; let the English overswarm all India , and hang out their blazing banner from the sun ; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer 's . 
For the sea is his ; he owns it , as Emperors own empires ; other seamen having but a right of way through it . 
Merchant ships are but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; even pirates and privateers , though following the sea as highwaymen the road . 
they but plunder other ships , other fragments of the land like themselves , without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself . 
The Nantucketer , he alone resides and riots on the sea ; he alone , in Bible language , goes down to it in ships ; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation .
