Its extreme downtown is the battery , where that noble mole is washed by waves , and cooled by breezes , which a few hours previous were out of sight of land . 
Look at the crowds of water-gazers there . 
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon . 
Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip , and from thence , by Whitehall , northward . 
What do you see ?
