I was away below the ferry now . 
I rose up , and there was Jackson 's Island , about two mile and a half down stream , heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river , big and dark and solid , like a steamboat without any lights . 
There war n't any signs of the bar at the head -- it was all under water now . 
It did n't take me long to get there . 
I shot past the head at a ripping rate , the current was so swift , and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore .
