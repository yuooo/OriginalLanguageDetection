My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology . 
I am the architect , not the builder . 
But it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is equal to it . 
To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them ; to have one 's hands among the unspeakable foundations , ribs , and very pelvis of the world ; this is a fearful thing . 
What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan !
