`` And he have one , two , tree -- oh ! 
good many iron in him hide , too , Captain , '' cried Queequeg disjointedly , `` all twiske-tee be-twisk , like him -- him - '' faltering hard for a word , and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle -- `` like him -- him - '' `` Corkscrew ! '' 
cried Ahab , `` aye , Queequeg , the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him ; aye , Daggoo , his spout is a big one , like a whole shock of wheat , and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing ; aye , Tashtego , and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall . 
Death and devils ! 
men , it is Moby Dick ye have seen -- Moby Dick -- Moby Dick ! ''
