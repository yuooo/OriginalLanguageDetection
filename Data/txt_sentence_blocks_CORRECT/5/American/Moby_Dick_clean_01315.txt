This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces , when stript and hoisted from the whale . 
When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents , this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros , especially by night . 
On one side , lit by a dull lantern , a space has been left clear for the workmen . 
They generally go in pairs , -- a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man . 
The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate 's boarding-weapon of the same name .
