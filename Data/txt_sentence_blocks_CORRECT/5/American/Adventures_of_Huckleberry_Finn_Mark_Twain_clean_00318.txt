The rain poured down , and never a light showed ; everybody in bed , I reckon . 
We boomed along down the river , watching for lights and watching for our raft . 
After a long time the rain let up , but the clouds stayed , and the lightning kept whimpering , and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead , floating , and we made for it . 
It was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again . 
We seen a light now away down to the right , on shore .
