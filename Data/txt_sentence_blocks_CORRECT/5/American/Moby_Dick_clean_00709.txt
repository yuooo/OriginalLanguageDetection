Those chaps in yonder boat ? 
Tut ! 
They are only five more hands come to help us never mind from where the more the merrier . 
Pull , then , do pull ; never mind the brimstone devils are good fellows enough . 
So , so ; there you are now ; that 's the stroke for a thousand pounds ; that 's the stroke to sweep the stakes !
