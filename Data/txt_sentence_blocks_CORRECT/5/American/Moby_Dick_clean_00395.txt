In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales , these three headsmen were as captains of companies . 
Or , being armed with their long keen whaling spears , they were as a picked trio of lancers ; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins . 
And since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a Gothic Knight of old , is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer , who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or elbowed in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally subsists between the two , a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the Pequod 's harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged . 
First of all was Queequeg , whom Starbuck , the chief mate , had selected for his squire . 
But Queequeg is already known .
