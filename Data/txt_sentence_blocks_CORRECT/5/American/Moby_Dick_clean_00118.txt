ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say -- here , here lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these . 
What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes ! 
What despair in those immovable inscriptions ! 
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave . 
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here .
