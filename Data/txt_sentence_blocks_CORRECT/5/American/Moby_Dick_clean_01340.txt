At length , when the last pint is casked , and all is cool , then the great hatchways are unsealed , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea . 
This done , the hatches are replaced , and hermetically closed , like a closet walled up . 
In the sperm fishery , this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling . 
One day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil ; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale 's head are profanely piled ; great rusty casks lie about , as in a brewery yard ; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks ; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness ; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself ; while on all hands the din is deafening . 
But a day or two after , you look about you , and prick your ears in this self-same ship !
