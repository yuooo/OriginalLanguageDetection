It was a Nantucket ship , the Bachelor , which had just wedged in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad holiday apparel , was joyously , though somewhat vain-gloriously , sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow for home . 
The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats ; from the stern , a whale-boat was suspended , bottom down ; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain . 
Signals , ensigns , and jacks of all colors were flying from her rigging , on every side . 
Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm ; above which , in her top-mast cross-trees , you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid ; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp . 
As was afterwards learned , the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success ; all the more wonderful , for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish .
