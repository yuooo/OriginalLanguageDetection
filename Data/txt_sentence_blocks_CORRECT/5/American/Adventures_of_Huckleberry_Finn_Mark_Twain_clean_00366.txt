how that snag 's tearing along . 
If you think it ai n't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night , you try it once -- you 'll see . 
Next , for about a half an hour , I whoops now and then ; at last I hears the answer a long ways off , and tries to follow it , but I could n't do it , and directly I judged I 'd got into a nest of towheads , for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me -- sometimes just a narrow channel between , and some that I could n't see I knowed was there because I 'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks . 
Well , I war n't long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads ; and I only tried to chase them a little while , anyway , because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o ' - lantern . 
You never knowed a sound dodge around so , and swap places so quick and so much .
