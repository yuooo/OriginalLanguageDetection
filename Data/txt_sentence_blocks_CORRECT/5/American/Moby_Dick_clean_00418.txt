Who 's made appointments with him in the hold ? 
Ai n't that queer , now ? 
But there 's no telling , it 's the old game -- Here goes for a snooze . 
Damn me , it 's worth a fellow 's while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep . 
And now that I think of it , that 's about the first thing babies do , and that 's a sort of queer , too .
