Two or three little children were playing here , and shrieked and scattered at his apparition , and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts . 
Out he shot into Hill Street again , three hundred yards from the tram-line end , and immediately he became aware of a tumultuous vociferation and running people . 
He glanced up the street towards the hill . 
Hardly a dozen yards off ran a huge navvy , cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade , and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched . 
Up the street others followed these two , striking and shouting .
