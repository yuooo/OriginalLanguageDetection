But by her still halting course and winding , woeful way , you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray , still remained without comfort . 
She was Rachel , weeping for her children , because they were not . 
The Cabin -LRB- Ahab moving to go on deck ; Pip catches him by the hand to follow . -RRB- 
Lad , lad , I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now . 
The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him , yet would not have thee by him .
