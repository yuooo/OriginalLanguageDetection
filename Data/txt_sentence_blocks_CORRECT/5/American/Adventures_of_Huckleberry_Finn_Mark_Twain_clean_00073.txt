I said it was pretty bad money , but maybe the hair-ball would take it , because maybe it would n't know the difference . 
Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it , and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good . 
He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night , and next morning you could n't see no brass , and it would n't feel greasy no more , and so anybody in town would take it in a minute , let alone a hair-ball . 
Well , I knowed a potato would do that before , but I had forgot it . 
Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball , and got down and listened again .
