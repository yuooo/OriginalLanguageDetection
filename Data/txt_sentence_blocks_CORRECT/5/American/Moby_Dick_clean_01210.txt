Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep , pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves , they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay . 
But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures . 
Though banding together in tens of thousands , the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman . 
Witness , too , all human beings , how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre 's pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush helter-skelter for the outlets , crowding , trampling , jamming , and remorselessly dashing each other to death . 
Best , therefore , withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us , for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men .
