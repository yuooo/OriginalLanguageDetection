Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again . 
Tying these two anchors here , Flask , seems like tying a man 's hands behind him . 
And what big generous hands they are , to be sure . 
These are your iron fists , hey ? 
What a hold they have , too !
