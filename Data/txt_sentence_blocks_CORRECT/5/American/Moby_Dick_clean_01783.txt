With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other 's heads to gain the uttermost stern . 
And now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac Ahab , furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated ; frenzied with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe . 
As now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ; the frail gunwales bent in , collapsed , and snapped , as both jaws , like an enormous shears , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two floating wrecks . 
These floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across . 
At that preluding moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , Ahab , the first to perceive the whale 's intent , by the crafty upraising of his head , a movement that loosed his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite .
