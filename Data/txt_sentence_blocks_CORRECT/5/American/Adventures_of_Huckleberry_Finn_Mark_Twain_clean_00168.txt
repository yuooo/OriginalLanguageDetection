Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened , but my breath come so hard I could n't hear nothing else . 
I slunk along another piece further , then listened again ; and so on , and so on . 
If I see a stump , I took it for a man ; if I trod on a stick and broke it , it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half , and the short half , too . 
When I got to camp I war n't feeling very brash , there war n't much sand in my craw ; but I says , this ai n't no time to be fooling around . 
So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight , and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year 's camp , and then clumb a tree .
