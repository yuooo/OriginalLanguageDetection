In black distress , I called my God , When I could scarce believe him mine , He bowed his ear to my complaints -- No more the whale did me confine . 
With speed he flew to my relief , As on a radiant dolphin borne ; Awful , yet bright , as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God . 
My song for ever shall record That terrible , that joyful hour ; I give the glory to my God , His all the mercy and the power . 
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn , which swelled high above the howling of the storm . 
A brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible , and at last , folding his hand down upon the proper page , said : `` Beloved shipmates , clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah -- ` And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . ' ''
