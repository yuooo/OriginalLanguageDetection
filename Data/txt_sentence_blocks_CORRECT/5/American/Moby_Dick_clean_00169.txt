I drew my bench near him , and made some friendly signs and hints , doing my best to talk with him meanwhile . 
At first he little noticed these advances ; but presently , upon my referring to his last night 's hospitalities , he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows . 
I told him yes ; whereat I thought he looked pleased , perhaps a little complimented . 
We then turned over the book together , and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it . 
Thus I soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town .
