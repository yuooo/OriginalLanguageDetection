I crossed Great Russell Street , glancing over my shoulder as I did so , and went some way along Montague Street before I realised what I was running towards . 
`` Then I became aware of a blare of music , and looking along the street saw a number of people advancing out of Russell Square , red shirts , and the banner of the Salvation Army to the fore . 
Such a crowd , chanting in the roadway and scoffing on the pavement , I could not hope to penetrate , and dreading to go back and farther from home again , and deciding on the spur of the moment , I ran up the white steps of a house facing the museum railings , and stood there until the crowd should have passed . 
Happily the dog stopped at the noise of the band too , hesitated , and turned tail , running back to Bloomsbury Square again . 
`` On came the band , bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about ` When shall we see His face ? '
