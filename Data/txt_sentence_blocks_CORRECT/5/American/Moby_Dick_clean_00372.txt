If that double-bolted land , Japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold . 
But if , in the face of all this , you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it , then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there , and unhorse you with a split helmet every time . 
The whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler , you will say . 
The whale no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler ? 
Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan ?
