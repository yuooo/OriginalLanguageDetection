I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg 's harpoon , which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him , before our mounting to the chamber . 
That 's strange , thought I ; but at any rate , since the harpoon stands yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it , therefore he must be inside here , and no possible mistake . 
`` Queequeg ! 
-- Queequeg ! '' 
-- all still .
