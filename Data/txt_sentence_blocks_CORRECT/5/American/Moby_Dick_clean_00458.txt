Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface . 
When the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it . 
On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back . 
The Fin-Back is not gregarious . 
He seems a whale-hater , as some men are man-haters .
