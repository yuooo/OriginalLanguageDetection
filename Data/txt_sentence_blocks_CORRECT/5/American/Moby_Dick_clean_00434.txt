It 's an honor ; I consider it an honor . 
Listen , wise Stubb . 
In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen , and made garter-knights of ; but , be your boast , Stubb , that ye were kicked by old Ahab , and made a wise man of . 
Remember what I say ; be kicked by him ; account his kicks honors ; and on no account kick back ; for you ca n't help yourself , wise Stubb . 
Do n't you see that pyramid ? '
