Now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this -- the first lives aft , the last forward . 
Hence , in whale-ships and merchantmen alike , the mates have their quarters with the captain ; and so , too , in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship . 
That is to say , they take their meals in the captain 's cabin , and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it . 
Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage -LRB- by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man -RRB- , the peculiar perils of it , and the community of interest prevailing among a company , all of whom , high or low , depend for their profits , not upon fixed wages , but upon their common luck , together with their common vigilance , intrepidity , and hard work ; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally ; yet , never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may , in some primitive instances , live together ; for all that , the punctilious externals , at least , of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed , and in no instance done away . 
Indeed , many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth .
