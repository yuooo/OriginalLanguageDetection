`` Has anybody been killed this year , Buck ? '' 
`` Yes ; we got one and they got one . 
` Bout three months ago my cousin Bud , fourteen year old , was riding through the woods on t ` other side of the river , and did n't have no weapon with him , which was blame ' foolishness , and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him , and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin ' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind ; and ` stead of jumping off and taking to the brush , Bud ` lowed he could out-run him ; so they had it , nip and tuck , for five mile or more , the old man a-gaining all the time ; so at last Bud seen it war n't any use , so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front , you know , and the old man he rode up and shot him down . 
But he did n't git much chance to enjoy his luck , for inside of a week our folks laid HIM out . '' 
`` I reckon that old man was a coward , Buck . ''
