I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all , or but very little , with the other seamen in the inn . 
He made no advances whatever ; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances . 
All this struck me as mighty singular ; yet , upon second thoughts , there was something almost sublime in it . 
Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home , by the way of Cape Horn , that is -- which was the only way he could get there -- thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter ; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease ; preserving the utmost serenity ; content with his own companionship ; always equal to himself . 
Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that .
