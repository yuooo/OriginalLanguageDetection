Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim 's meat , and the dogs went for it , and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door , and I knowed he 'd fixed the other door too . 
Then he went to work on the nigger , coaxing him and petting him , and asking him if he 'd been imagining he saw something again . 
He raised up , and blinked his eyes around , and says : `` Mars Sid , you 'll say I 's a fool , but if I did n't b ` lieve I see most a million dogs , er devils , er some ` n , I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks . 
I did , mos ' sholy . 
Mars Sid , I FELT um -- I FELT um , sah ; dey was all over me .
