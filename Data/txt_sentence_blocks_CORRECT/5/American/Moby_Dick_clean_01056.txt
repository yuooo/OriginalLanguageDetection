In a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two fronts -LRB- side fronts -RRB- : for what is it that makes the front of a man -- what , indeed , but his eyes ? 
Moreover , while in most other animals that I can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale 's eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts . 
The whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him . 
Man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window . 
But with the whale , these two sashes are separately inserted , making two distinct windows , but sadly impairing the view .
