And this reminds me that certain Englishmen , who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel -- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber . 
Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called `` fritters '' ; which , indeed , they greatly resemble , being brown and crisp , and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives ' dough-nuts or oly-cooks , when fresh . 
They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off . 
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness . 
He is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good .
