It was according to the old saying , `` Give a nigger an inch and he 'll take an ell . ''

Here was this nigger , which I had as good as helped to run away , coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children -- children that belonged to a man I did n't even know ; a man that had n't ever done me no harm . 
I was sorry to hear Jim say that , it was such a lowering of him .
