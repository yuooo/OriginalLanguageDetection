Then Tom said he had n't got candles enough , and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more . 
I did n't want him to try . 
I said Jim might wake up and come . 
But Tom wanted to resk it ; so we slid in there and got three candles , and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay . 
Then we got out , and I was in a sweat to get away ; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was , on his hands and knees , and play something on him .
