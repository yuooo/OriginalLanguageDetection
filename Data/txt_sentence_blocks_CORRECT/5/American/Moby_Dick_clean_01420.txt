Did erudite Stubb , mounted upon your capstan , deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea ; and by help of the windlass , hold up a specimen rib for exhibition ? 
Explain thyself , Ishmael . 
Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination , as a cook dishes a roast-pig ? 
Surely not . 
A veritable witness have you hitherto been , Ishmael ; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone ; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams ; the rafters , ridge-pole , sleepers , and under-pinnings , making up the frame-work of leviathan ; and belike of the tallow-vats , dairy-rooms , butteries , and cheeseries in his bowels .
