happy that the world is such an excellent listener ! 
Now , the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale , chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air , and for several feet laid along , horizontally , just beneath the upper surface of his head , and a little to one side ; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street . 
But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe ; in other words , whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath , or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and discharged through the spiracle . 
It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal ; but it can not be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle . 
Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be , when in feeding he accidentally takes in water .
