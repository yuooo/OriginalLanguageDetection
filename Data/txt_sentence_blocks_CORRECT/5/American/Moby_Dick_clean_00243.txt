Still , for all this immutableness , was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad . 
Though refusing , from conscientious scruples , to bear arms against land invaders , yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific ; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed , yet had he in his straight-bodied coat , spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore . 
How now in the contemplative evening of his days , the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence , I do not know ; but it did not seem to concern him much , and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man 's religion is one thing , and this practical world quite another . 
This world pays dividends . 
Rising from a little cabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab , to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat ; from that becoming boat-header , chief mate , and captain , and finally a shipowner ; Bildad , as I hinted before , had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty , and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income .
