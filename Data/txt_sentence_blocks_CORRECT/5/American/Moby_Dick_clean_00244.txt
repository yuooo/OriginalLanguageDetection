Now , Bildad , I am sorry to say , had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks , and in his sea-going days , a bitter , hard task-master . 
They told me in Nantucket , though it certainly seems a curious story , that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman , his crew , upon arriving home , were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital , sore exhausted and worn out . 
For a pious man , especially for a Quaker , he was certainly rather hard-hearted , to say the least . 
He never used to swear , though , at his men , they said ; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel , unmitigated hard work out of them . 
When Bildad was a chief-mate , to have his drab-colored eye intently looking at you , made you feel completely nervous , till you could clutch something -- a hammer or a marling-spike , and go to work like mad , at something or other , never mind what .
