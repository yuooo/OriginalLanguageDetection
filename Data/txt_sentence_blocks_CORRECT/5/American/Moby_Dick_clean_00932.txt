he cried at length , widening his legs still further , as if to form a more secure base for his supper ; and , at the same time darting his fork into the dish , as if stabbing with his lance ; `` cook , you cook ! 
-- sail this way , cook ! '' 
The old black , not in any very high glee at having been previously routed from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour , came shambling along from his galley , for , like many old blacks , there was something the matter with his knee-pans , which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans ; this old Fleece , as they called him , came shuffling and limping along , assisting his step with his tongs , which , after a clumsy fashion , were made of straightened iron hoops ; this old Ebony floundered along , and in obedience to the word of command , came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb 's sideboard ; when , with both hands folded before him , and resting on his two-legged cane , he bowed his arched back still further over , at the same time sideways inclining his head , so as to bring his best ear into play . 
`` Cook , '' said Stubb , rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth , `` do n't you think this steak is rather overdone ? 
You 've been beating this steak too much , cook ; it 's too tender .
