I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid , and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ; then I done the same with the side of bacon ; then the whisky-jug . 
I took all the coffee and sugar there was , and all the ammunition ; I took the wadding ; I took the bucket and gourd ; I took a dipper and a tin cup , and my old saw and two blankets , and the skillet and the coffee-pot . 
I took fish-lines and matches and other things -- everything that was worth a cent . 
I cleaned out the place . 
I wanted an axe , but there was n't any , only the one out at the woodpile , and I knowed why I was going to leave that .
