And , mind you , when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart ; she do n't clap them together , the way you did when you catched the lump of lead . 
Why , I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle ; and I contrived the other things just to make certain . 
Now trot along to your uncle , Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters , and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus , which is me , and I 'll do what I can to get you out of it . 
Keep the river road all the way , and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you . 
The river road 's a rocky one , and your feet 'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen , I reckon . ''
