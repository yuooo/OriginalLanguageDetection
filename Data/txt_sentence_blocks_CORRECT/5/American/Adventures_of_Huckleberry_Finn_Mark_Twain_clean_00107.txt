His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial ; but then there was ways to put it off a long time , and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it . 
And he said people allowed there 'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian , and they guessed it would win this time . 
This shook me up considerable , because I did n't want to go back to the widow 's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized , as they called it . 
Then the old man got to cussing , and cussed everything and everybody he could think of , and then cussed them all over again to make sure he had n't skipped any , and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round , including a considerable parcel of people which he did n't know the names of , and so called them what 's - his-name when he got to them , and went right along with his cussing . 
He said he would like to see the widow get me .
