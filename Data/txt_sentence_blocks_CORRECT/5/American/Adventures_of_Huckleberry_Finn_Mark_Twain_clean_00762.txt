So I went to studying it out . 
I says to myself , I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks , though I ai n't had no experience , and ca n't say for certain ; but it looks so to me , anyway ; and yet here 's a case where I 'm blest if it do n't look to me like the truth is better and actuly SAFER than a lie . 
I must lay it by in my mind , and think it over some time or other , it 's so kind of strange and unregular . 
I never see nothing like it . 
Well , I says to myself at last , I 'm a-going to chance it ; I 'll up and tell the truth this time , though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you 'll go to .
