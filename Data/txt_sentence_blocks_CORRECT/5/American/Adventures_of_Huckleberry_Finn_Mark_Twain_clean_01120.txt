I shot out and went for the doctor 's house , but they told me he 'd gone away in the night some time or other , and war n't back yet . 
Well , thinks I , that looks powerful bad for Tom , and I 'll dig out for the island right off . 
So away I shoved , and turned the corner , and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas 's stomach ! 
He says : `` Why , TOM ! 
Where you been all this time , you rascal ? ''
