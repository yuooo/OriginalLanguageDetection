Hines let out a whoop , like everybody else , and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look , and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ai n't nobody can tell . 
I had the road all to myself , and I fairly flew -- leastways , I had it all to myself except the solid dark , and the now-and-then glares , and the buzzing of the rain , and the thrashing of the wind , and the splitting of the thunder ; and sure as you are born I did clip it along ! 
When I struck the town I see there war n't nobody out in the storm , so I never hunted for no back streets , but humped it straight through the main one ; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it . 
No light there ; the house all dark -- which made me feel sorry and disappointed , I did n't know why . 
But at last , just as I was sailing by , FLASH comes the light in Mary Jane 's window !
