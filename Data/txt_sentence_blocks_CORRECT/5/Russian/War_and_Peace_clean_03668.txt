Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six . 
And in the fifth verse of the same chapter : And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months . 
The French alphabet , written out with the same numerical values as the Hebrew , in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens , will have the following significance : a b c d e f g h i k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 l m n o p q r s 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 t u v w x y 100 110 120 130 140 150 z 160 Writing the words L'Empereur Napoleon in numbers , it appears that the sum of them is 666 , and that Napoleon therefore the beast foretold in the Apocalypse . 
Moreover , by applying the same system to the words quarante-deux , * which was the term allowed to the beast that `` spoke great things and blasphemies , '' the same number 666 was obtained ; from which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon 's power had come in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two . 
This prophecy pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the beast , that is , of Napoleon , and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up , to find an answer to the question that engrossed him .
