The reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him , the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read , and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal . 
The party of the old and dissatisfied , who censured the innovations , turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms , simply because he was the son of his father . 
The feminine society world welcomed him gladly , because he was rich , distinguished , a good match , and almost a newcomer , with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife . 
Besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years , having softened and grown more manly , lost his former affectation , pride , and contemptuous irony , and acquired the serenity that comes with years . 
People talked about him , were interested in him , and wanted to meet him .
