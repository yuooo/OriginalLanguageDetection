A French noncommissioned officer of hussars , in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap , shouted to the approaching Balashev to halt . 
Balashev did not do so at once , but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace . 
The noncommissioned officer frowned and , muttering words of abuse , advanced his horse 's chest against Balashev , put his hand to his saber , and shouted rudely at the Russian general , asking : was he deaf that he did not do as he was told ? 
Balashev mentioned who he was . 
The noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the Russian general .
