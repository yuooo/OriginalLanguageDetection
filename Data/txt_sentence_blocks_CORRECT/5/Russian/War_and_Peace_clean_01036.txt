It was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner , and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy . 
`` Left ... left ... left ... '' he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step ; and in time to this , with stern but varied faces , the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step , and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step , `` Left ... left ... left ... '' A fat major skirted a bush , puffing and falling out of step ; a soldier who had fallen behind , his face showing alarm at his defection , ran at a trot , panting to catch up with his company . 
A cannon ball , cleaving the air , flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite , and fell into the column to the measure of `` Left ... left ! '' 
`` Close up ! '' 
came the company commander 's voice in jaunty tones .
