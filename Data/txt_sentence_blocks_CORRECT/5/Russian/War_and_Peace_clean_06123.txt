One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas , and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making free use of his fists . 
At first he saw nothing reprehensible in this , but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed . 
Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from Bogucharovo , a man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of dishonesty and various irregularities . 
Nicholas went out into the porch to question him , and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were heard . 
On returning to lunch Nicholas went up to his wife , who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame , and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning .
