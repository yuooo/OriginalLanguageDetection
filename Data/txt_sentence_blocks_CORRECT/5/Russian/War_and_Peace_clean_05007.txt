When Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party , she had at first asked many questions : Where was he going ? 
How was he wounded ? 
Was it serious ? 
And could she see him ? 
But after she had been told that she could not see him , that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger , she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all , evidently disbelieving what they told her , and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same .
