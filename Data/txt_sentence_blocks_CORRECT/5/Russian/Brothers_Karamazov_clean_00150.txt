And do you know I foresaw , too , that you 'd be the first to remark on it . 
The minute I see my joke is n't coming off , your reverence , both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the lower jaw and there is almost a spasm in them . 
That 's been so since I was young , when I had to make jokes for my living in noblemen 's families . 
I am an inveterate buffoon , and have been from birth up , your reverence , it 's as though it were a craze in me . 
I dare say it 's a devil within me .
