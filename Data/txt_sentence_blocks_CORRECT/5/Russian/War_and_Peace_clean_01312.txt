If he is not rich I will give her the means ; I will ask my father and Andrew . 
I shall be so happy when she is his wife . 
She is so unfortunate , a stranger , alone , helpless ! 
And , oh God , how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself ! 
Perhaps I might have done the same !
