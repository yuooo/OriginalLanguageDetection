Having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel , evil nature , and little Nicholas , following her example , would sob , and without permission would leave his corner , come to her , pull her wet hands from her face , and comfort her . 
But what distressed the princess most of all was her father 's irritability , which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty . 
Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night , had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water , it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard ; but this loving despot -- the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her -- knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately , but to show her that she was always to blame for everything . 
Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented Princess Mary more than anything else ; this was his ever-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
The idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his son 's intentions had occurred to him in jest -- that if Andrew got married he himself would marry Bourienne -- had evidently pleased him , and latterly he had persistently , and as it seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend her , shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of Bourienne .
