But even if -- imagining a man quite exempt from all influences , examining only his momentary action in the present , unevoked by any cause -- we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero , we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man , for a being uninfluenced by the external world , standing outside of time and independent of cause , is no longer a man . 
In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability . 
-LRB- 1 -RRB- However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated , that knowledge can never be complete , for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space . 
And therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined , there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it , that period will be finite , while time is infinite , and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability .
