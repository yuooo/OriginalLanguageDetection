Once Belyavsky - he was a handsome fellow , and rich - used to like to come here and hang about her - suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence . 
And she - such a mild sheep - why , I thought she would have knocked me down for that blow . 
How she set on me ! 
` You 're beaten , beaten now , ' she said , ` You 've taken a blow from him . 
You have been trying to sell me to him , ' she said ... ` And how dared he strike you in my presence !
