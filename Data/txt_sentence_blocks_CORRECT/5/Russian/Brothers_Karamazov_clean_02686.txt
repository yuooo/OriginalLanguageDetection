Mitya remembered their faces , greeting and embracing everyone he knew . 
He uncorked bottles and poured out wine for everyone who presented himself . 
Only the girls were very eager for the champagne . 
The men preferred rum , brandy , and , above all , hot punch . 
Mitya had chocolate made for all the girls , and ordered that three samovars should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to help himself .
