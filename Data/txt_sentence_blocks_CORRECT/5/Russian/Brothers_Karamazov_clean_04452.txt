Beginning life of noble birth , but in a poor dependent position , through an unexpected marriage he came into a small fortune . 
A petty knave , a toady and buffoon , of fairly good , though undeveloped , intelligence , he was , above all , a moneylender , who grew bolder with growing prosperity . 
His abject and servile characteristics disappeared , his , malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that remained . 
On the spiritual side he was undeveloped , while his vitality was excessive . 
He saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure , and he brought his children up to be the same .
