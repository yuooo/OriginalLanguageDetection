A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter , and sees in this the purpose of the bee 's existence . 
Another , observing the migration of plants , notices that the bee helps in this work , and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee . 
But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first , the second , or any of the processes the human mind can discern . 
The higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes , the more obvious it becomes , that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension . 
All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to other manifestations of life .
