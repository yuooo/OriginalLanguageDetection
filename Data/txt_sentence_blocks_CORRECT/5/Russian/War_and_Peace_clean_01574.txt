But he saw nothing . 
Above him there was now nothing but the sky -- the lofty sky , not clear yet still immeasurably lofty , with gray clouds gliding slowly across it . 
`` How quiet , peaceful , and solemn ; not at all as I ran , '' thought Prince Andrew -- `` not as we ran , shouting and fighting , not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop : how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky ! 
How was it I did not see that lofty sky before ? 
And how happy I am to have found it at last !
