If the realist once believes , then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous also . 
The Apostle Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw , but when he did see he said , `` My Lord and my God ! '' 
Was it the miracle forced him to believe ? 
Most likely not , but he believed solely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart even when he said , `` I do not believe till I see . '' 
I shall be told , perhaps , that Alyosha was stupid , undeveloped , had not finished his studies , and so on .
