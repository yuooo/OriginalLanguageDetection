You wanted to make yourself another man by suffering . 
I say , only remember that other man always , all your life and wherever you go ; and that will be enough for you . 
Your refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all your life even greater duty , and that constant feeling will do more to make you a new man , perhaps , than if you went there . 
For there you would not endure it and would repine , and perhaps at last would say : ' I am quits . ' 
The lawyer was right about that .
