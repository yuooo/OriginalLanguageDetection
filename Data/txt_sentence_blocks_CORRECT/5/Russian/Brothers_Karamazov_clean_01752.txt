At the dawn of my life when I was a child I had an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen . 
And later on in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that that brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me . 
For had he not come into my life , I should never perhaps , so I fancy at least , have become a monk and entered on this precious path . 
He appeared first to me in my childhood , and here , at the end of my pilgrimage , he seems to have come to me over again . 
It is marvellous , fathers and teachers , that Alexey , who has some , though not a great , resemblance in face , seems to me so like him spiritually , that many times I have taken him for that young man , my brother , mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage , as a reminder and an inspiration .
