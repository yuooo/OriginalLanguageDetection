The news of Count Bezukhov 's death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it . 
He says the count was the last representative but one of the great century , and that it is his own turn now , but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible . 
God preserve us from that terrible misfortune ! 
I can not agree with you about Pierre , whom I knew as a child . 
He always seemed to me to have an excellent heart , and that is the quality I value most in people .
