Yes , it 's worth saying a word or two about that envelope . 
I was somewhat surprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of himself - of himself , observe - that but for that envelope , but for its being left on the floor , no one in the world would have known of the existence of that envelope and the notes in it , and therefore of the prisoner 's having stolen it . 
And so that torn scrap of paper is , by the prosecutor 's own admission , the sole proof on which the charge of robbery rests , ` otherwise no one would have known of the robbery , nor perhaps even of the money . ' 
But is the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a proof that there was money in it , and that that money had been stolen ? 
Yet , it will be objected , Smerdyakov had seen the money in the envelope .
