The squadron in which Nicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the German village of Salzeneck . 
The best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalry-captain Denisov , the squadron commander , known throughout the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov . 
Cadet Rostov , ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland , had lived with the squadron commander . 
On October 11 , the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of Mack 's defeat , the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual . 
Denisov , who had been losing at cards all night , had not yet come home when Rostov rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition .
