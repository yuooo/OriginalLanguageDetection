The Austrian general looked dissatisfied , but had no option but to reply in the same tone . 
`` On the contrary , '' he said , in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words , `` on the contrary , your excellency 's participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty ; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles , '' he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence . 
Kutuzov bowed with the same smile . 
`` But that is my conviction , and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me , I imagine that the Austrian troops , under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack , have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid , '' said Kutuzov . 
The general frowned .
