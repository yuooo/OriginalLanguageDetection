This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal , but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself . 
The soldier they called `` Jackdaw , '' a thin little fellow with a sharp nose , rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender , handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood . 
`` Bring it here -- that 's fine ! '' 
They split up the wood , pressed it down on the fire , blew at it with their mouths , and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats , making the flames hiss and crackle . 
The men drew nearer and lit their pipes .
