These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs ; they assure the officer on duty that they , the marshals , are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg . 
He lets them enter the tete-de-pont . 
* They spin him a thousand gasconades , saying that the war is over , that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte , that they desire to see Prince Auersperg , and so on . 
The officer sends for Auersperg ; these gentlemen embrace the officers , crack jokes , sit on the cannon , and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved , flings the bags of incendiary material into the water , and approaches the tete-de-pont . 
At length appears the lieutenant general , our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself .
