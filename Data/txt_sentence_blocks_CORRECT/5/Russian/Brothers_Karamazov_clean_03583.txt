I go to him every day and simply wonder at him . 
Tell me , now , what do you suppose he 's always talking about ? 
He talks and talks and I can make nothing of it . 
I fancied he was talking of something intellectual that I could n't understand in my foolishness . 
Only he suddenly began talking to me about a babe - that is , about some child .
