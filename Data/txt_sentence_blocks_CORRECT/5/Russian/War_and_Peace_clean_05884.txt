These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest . 
They came up to the fire , hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand . 
One was taller than the other ; he wore an officer 's hat and seemed quite exhausted . 
On approaching the fire he had been going to sit down , but fell . 
The other , a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round his head , was stronger .
