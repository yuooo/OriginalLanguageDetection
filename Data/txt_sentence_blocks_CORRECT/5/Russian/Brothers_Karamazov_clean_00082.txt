I must digress to explain what an `` elder '' is in Russian monasteries , and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent to do so . 
I will try , however , to give a superficial account of it in a few words . 
Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of `` elders '' is of recent date , not more than a hundred years old in our monasteries , though in the orthodox East , especially in Sinai and Athos , it has existed over a thousand years . 
It is maintained that it existed in ancient times in Russia also , but through the calamities which overtook Russia - the Tartars , civil war , the interruption of relations with the East after the destruction of Constantinople - this institution fell into oblivion . 
It was revived among us towards the end of last century by one of the great `` ascetics , '' as they called him , Paissy Velitchkovsky , and his disciples .
