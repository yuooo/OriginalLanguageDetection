When she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at her shoulders , and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look into hers rather than this . 
But looking into his eyes she was frightened , realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men . 
She did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man . 
When she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck . 
They spoke of most ordinary things , yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man .
