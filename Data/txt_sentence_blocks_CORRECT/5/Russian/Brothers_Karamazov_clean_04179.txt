Yes , there is that romantic strain in you , that was so derided by Byelinsky . 
I ca n't help it , young man , as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the Caucasus , with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat . 
But I was positively afraid of doing it , for you 'd have thrashed me for daring to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat , instead of , at least , the Polar Star or the Sirius . 
And you keep on saying I am stupid , but , mercy on us ! 
I make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence .
