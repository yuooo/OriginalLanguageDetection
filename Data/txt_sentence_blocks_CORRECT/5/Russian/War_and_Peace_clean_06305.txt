Modern history , in theory , rejects both these principles . 
It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man 's subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led , modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it . 
But modern history has not done this . 
Having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients , it still follows them in practice . 
Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of God , modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary , superhuman capacities , or simply men of very various kinds , from monarchs to journalists , who lead the masses .
