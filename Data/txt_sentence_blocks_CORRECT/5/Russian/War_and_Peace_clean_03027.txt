In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to , no one to whom to confide her sorrow , and much sorrow fell to her lot just then . 
The time for Prince Andrew 's return and marriage was approaching , but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out ; in fact , it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless , for at every mention of the young Countess Rostova the old prince -LRB- who apart from that was usually in a bad temper -RRB- lost control of himself . 
Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old nephew . 
To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little Nicholas some symptoms of her father 's irritability . 
However often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew , almost every time that , pointer in hand , she sat down to show him the French alphabet , she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child -- who was already afraid that Auntie might at any moment get angry -- that at his slightest inattention she trembled , became flustered and heated , raised her voice , and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner .
