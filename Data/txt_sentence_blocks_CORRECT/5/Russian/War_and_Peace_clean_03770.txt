It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolensk to save our lines of communication . 
The battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides . 
Smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the whole people . 
But Smolensk was burned by its own inhabitants-who had been misled by their governor . 
And these ruined inhabitants , setting an example to other Russians , went to Moscow thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe .
