And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during the whole campaign , and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting `` Hurrah ! '' 
Kutuzov 's words were hardly understood by the troops . 
No one could have repeated the field marshal 's address , begun solemnly and then changing into an old man 's simplehearted talk ; but the hearty sincerity of that speech , the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause , exactly expressed by that old man 's good-natured expletives , was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and long-sustained shouts . 
Afterwards when one of the generals addressed Kutuzov asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for , Kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a sob , being evidently greatly moved .
