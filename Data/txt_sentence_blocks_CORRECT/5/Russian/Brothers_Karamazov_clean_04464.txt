What is more , he can be carried off his feet , positively carried off his feet by noble ideals , but only if they come of themselves , if they fall from heaven for him , if they need not be paid for . 
He dislikes paying for anything , but is very fond of receiving , and that 's so with him in everything . 
Oh , give him every possible good in life -LRB- he could n't be content with less -RRB- , and put no obstacle in his way , and he will show that he , too , can be noble . 
He is not greedy , no , but he must have money , a great deal of money , and you will see how generously , with what scorn of filthy lucre , he will fling it all away in the reckless dissipation of one night . 
But if he has not money , he will show what he is ready to do to get it when he is in great need of it .
