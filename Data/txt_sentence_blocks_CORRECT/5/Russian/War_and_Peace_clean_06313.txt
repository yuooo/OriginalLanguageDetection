In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him , but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people . 
Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow ; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow , and the Emperor Alexander , helped by the advice of Stein and others , united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace . 
All Napoleon 's allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised . 
The Allies defeated Napoleon , entered Paris , forced Napoleon to abdicate , and sent him to the island of Elba , not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him every respect , though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand . 
Then Louis XVIII , who till then had been the laughingstock both of the French and the Allies , began to reign .
