I will myself direct your battalions . 
I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy 's ranks , but should victory be in doubt , even for a moment , you will see your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy , for there must be no doubt of victory , especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the French infantry , so necessary to the honor of our nation . 
Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded ! 
Let every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of England , inspired by such hatred of our nation ! 
This victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters , where fresh French troops who are being raised in France will join us , and the peace I shall conclude will be worthy of my people , of you , and of myself .
