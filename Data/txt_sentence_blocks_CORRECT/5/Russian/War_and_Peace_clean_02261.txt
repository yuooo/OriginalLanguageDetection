Denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed . 
Next day he woke calm and cheerful . 
But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostov 's and Denisov 's dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about yesterday 's occurrence . 
The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn : that a court-martial had been appointed , and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded , degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for . 
The case , as represented by the offended parties , was that , after seizing the transports , Major Denisov , being drunk , went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief , threatened to strike him , and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing , and dislocated the arm of one of them .
