`` Well , old fellow , '' said he to the peasant guide , `` lead us to Shamshevo . '' 
Denisov , Petya , and the esaul , accompanied by some Cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner , rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the forest . 
The rain had stopped , and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees . 
Denisov , the esaul , and Petya rode silently , following the peasant in the knitted cap who , stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves , silently led them to the edge of the forest . 
He ascended an incline , stopped , looked about him , and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense .
