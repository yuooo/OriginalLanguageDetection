Prince Vasili looked questioningly at the princess , but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him . 
`` There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant , mon cousin , '' she replied , `` and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this ... '' `` Yes , yes , of course , '' interrupted Prince Vasili impatiently , rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away . 
`` But ... in short , the fact is ... you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property , not to us his direct heirs , but to Pierre . '' 
`` He has made wills enough ! '' 
quietly remarked the princess .
