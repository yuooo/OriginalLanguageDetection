Hadst Thou taken the world and Caesar 's purple , Thou wouldst have founded the universal state and have given universal peace . 
For who can rule men if not he who holds their conscience and their bread in his hands ? 
We have taken the sword of Caesar , and in taking it , of course , have rejected Thee and followed him . 
Oh , ages are yet to come of the confusion of free thought , of their science and cannibalism . 
For having begun to build their tower of Babel without us , they will end , of course , with cannibalism .
