He was so sure that he really was the King of Naples that when , on the eve of his departure from that city , while walking through the streets with his wife , some Italians called out to him : `` Viva il re ! '' 
* he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said : `` Poor fellows , they do n't know that I am leaving them tomorrow ! '' 
* `` Long live the king . '' 
But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning , latterly , after he had been ordered to return to military service -- and especially since his last interview with Napoleon in Danzig , when his august brother-in-law had told him : `` I made you King that you should reign in my way , but not in yours ! '' 
-- he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business , and -- like a well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts -- he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible , and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of Poland , without himself knowing why or whither .
