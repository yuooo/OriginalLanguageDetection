On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkonski to Kutuzov with the following rescript : Prince Michael Ilarionovich ! 
Since the twenty-ninth of August I have received no communication from you , yet on the first of September I received from the commander in chief of Moscow , via Yaroslavl , the sad news that you , with the army , have decided to abandon Moscow . 
You can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me , and your silence increases my astonishment . 
I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince Volkonski , to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision . 
Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow , a messenger from Kutuzov reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event .
