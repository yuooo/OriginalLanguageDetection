No one now loves virtue ; it seems like a reproach to everyone . 
Now tell me , Count , was it right , was it honorable , of Bezukhov ? 
And Fedya , with his noble spirit , loved him and even now never says a word against him . 
Those pranks in Petersburg when they played some tricks on a policeman , did n't they do it together ? 
And there !
