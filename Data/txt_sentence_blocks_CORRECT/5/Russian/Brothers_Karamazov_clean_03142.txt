The Evidences of the Witnesses . 
The Babe THE examination of the witnesses began . 
But we will not continue our story in such detail as before . 
And so we will not dwell on how Nikolay Parfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must give his evidence in accordance with truth and conscience , and that he would afterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath , how every witness was called upon to sign the protocol of his evidence , and so on . 
We will only note that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was the question of the three thousand roubles ; that is , was the sum spent here , at Mokroe , by Mitya on the first occasion , a month before , three thousand or fifteen hundred ?
