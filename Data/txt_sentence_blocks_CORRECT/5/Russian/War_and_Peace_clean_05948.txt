At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned . 
He called on Count Rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow , and he intended to leave for Petersburg two days later .

Pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all , but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way .
