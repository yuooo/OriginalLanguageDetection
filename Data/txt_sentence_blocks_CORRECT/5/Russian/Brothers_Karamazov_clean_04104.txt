I am very fond of them ... only fancy , they imagine that they are serving the cause of religion , because the devils show them their horns from the other world . 
That , they say , is a material proof , so to speak , of the existence of another world . 
The other world and material proofs , what next ! 
And if you come to that , does proving there 's a devil prove that there 's a God ? 
I want to join an idealist society , I 'll lead the opposition in it , I 'll say I am a realist , but not a materialist , he he ! ''
