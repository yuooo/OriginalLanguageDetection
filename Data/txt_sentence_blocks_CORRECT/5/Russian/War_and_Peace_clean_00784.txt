Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before . 
It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German , and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects . 
A fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind . 
A woman with an unweaned baby , an old woman , and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds . 
Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission .
