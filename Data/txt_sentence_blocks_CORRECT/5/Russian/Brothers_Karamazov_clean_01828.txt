`` No , '' they would say , `` he is a brave fellow , he faced fire and could have fired his own pistol too , but he had a dream the night before that he should become a monk , that 's why he did it . '' 
It was the same thing with the society of the town . 
Till then I had been kindly received , but had not been the object of special attention , and now all came to know me at once and invited me ; they laughed at me , but they loved me . 
I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel , the authorities took no notice of it , because my antagonist was a near relation of our general , and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences , and as I resigned my commission , they took it as a joke . 
And I began then to speak aloud and fearlessly , regardless of their laughter , for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter .
