A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Helene gave at her country house on the Stone Island , the charming Monsieur de Jobert , a man no longer young , with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes , a Jesuit a robe courte * was presented to her , and in the garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of the love of God , of Christ , of the Sacred Heart , and of the consolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and the next . 
Helene was touched , and more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled . 
A dance , for which her partner came to seek her , put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de conscience , but the next evening Monsieur de Jobert came to see Helene when she was alone , and after that often came again . 
* Lay member of the Society of Jesus . 
One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church , where she knelt down before the altar to which she was led .
