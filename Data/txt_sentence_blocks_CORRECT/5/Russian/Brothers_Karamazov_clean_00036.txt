He had come from Paris , which was his permanent home . 
I remember that he was more surprised than anyone when he made the acquaintance of the young man , who interested him extremely , and with whom he sometimes argued and not without inner pang compared himself in acquirements . 
`` He is proud , '' he used to say , `` he will never be in want of pence ; he has got money enough to go abroad now . 
What does he want here ? 
Everyone can see that he has n't come for money , for his father would never give him any .
