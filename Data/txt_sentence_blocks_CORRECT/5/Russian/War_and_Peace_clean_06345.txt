We learn that Luther had a hot temper and said such and such things ; we learn that Rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books ; but we do not learn why after the Reformation the peoples massacred one another , nor why during the French Revolution they guillotined one another . 
If we unite both these kinds of history , as is done by the newest historians , we shall have the history of monarchs and writers , but not the history of the life of the peoples . 
The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men , for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found . 
The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history . 
The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes , but in its application to history , as soon as revolutions , conquests , or civil wars occur -- that is , as soon as history begins -- that theory explains nothing .
