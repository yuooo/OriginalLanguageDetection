It happened once , when Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk , that he dropped in the muddy courtyard three hundred-rouble notes which he had only just received . 
He only missed them next day , and was just hastening to search his pockets when he saw the notes lying on the table . 
Where had they come from ? 
Smerdyakov had picked them up and brought them in the day before . 
`` Well , my lad , I 've never met anyone like you , '' Fyodor Pavlovitch said shortly , and gave him ten roubles .
