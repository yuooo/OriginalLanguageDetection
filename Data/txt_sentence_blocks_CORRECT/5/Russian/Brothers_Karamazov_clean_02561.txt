If you wo n't , I am glad to see you ... '' `` Me , me frighten you ? '' 
cried Mitya , flinging up his hands . 
`` Oh , pass me by , go your way , I wo n't hinder you ! 
... '' And suddenly he surprised them all , and no doubt himself as well , by flinging himself on a chair , and bursting into tears , turning his head away to the opposite wall , while his arms clasped the back of the chair tight , as though embracing it . 
`` Come , come , what a fellow you are ! ''
