Petya 's death had torn from her half her life . 
When the news of Petya 's death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty , but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life . 
But the same blow that almost killed the countess , this second blow , restored Natasha to life . 
A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and , strange as it may seem , just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join , physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within . 
Natasha 's wound healed in that way .
