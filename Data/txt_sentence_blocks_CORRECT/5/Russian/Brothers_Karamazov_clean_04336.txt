I have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts , for no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts ; you are the only one that ever did . ' 
then I remembered my happy youth and the poor child in the yard , without boots on his feet , and my heart was touched and I said , ` You are a grateful young man , for you have remembered all your life the pound of nuts I bought you in your childhood . ' 
And I embraced him and blessed him . 
And I shed tears . 
He laughed , but he shed tears , too ... for the Russian often laughs when he ought to be weeping .
