`` Yes , it is the same oak , '' thought Prince Andrew , and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal . 
All the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory . 
Austerlitz with the lofty heavens , his wife 's dead reproachful face , Pierre at the ferry , that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night , and that night itself and the moon , and ... . 
all this rushed suddenly to his mind . 
`` No , life is not over at thirty-one ! ''
