It was evening . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch , whom she had not seen for those eight years , came in to her drunk . 
The story is that instantly upon seeing him , without any sort of explanation , she gave him two good , resounding slaps on the face , seized him by a tuft of hair , and shook him three times up and down . 
Then , without a word , she went straight to the cottage to the two boys . 
Seeing , at the first glance , that they were unwashed and in dirty linen , she promptly gave Grigory , too , a box on the ear , and announcing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped them just as they were in a rug , put them in the carriage , and drove off to her own town .
