You see , it was all to do with the old man , my dead father . 
He was always pestering Agrafena and I was jealous ; I thought then that she was hesitating between me and him . 
So I kept thinking everyday , suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden , suppose she were to leave off tormenting me , and were suddenly to say to me , ' I love you , not him ; take me to the other end of the world . ' 
And I 'd only forty copecks ; how could I take her away , what could I do ? 
Why , I 'd be lost .
