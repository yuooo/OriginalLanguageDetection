The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet . 
`` Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity of your conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your affection for your unhappy brother . 
Your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode is known to us already from the preliminary investigation . 
I wo n't attempt to conceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all the other evidence collected by the prosecution . 
And so I think it essential to press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your brother 's innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom you gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry ? ''
