The old count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose . 
Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word , and his father , sighing and evidently disconcerted , very soon became silent and went in to the countess . 
In all his encounters with his son , the count was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune , and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless Sonya . 
On this occasion , he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder , no better wife for Nicholas than Sonya could have been wished for , and that no one but himself with his Mitenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances . 
The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again , but a few days later the countess sent for Sonya and , with a cruelty neither of them expected , reproached her niece for trying to catch Nicholas and for ingratitude .
