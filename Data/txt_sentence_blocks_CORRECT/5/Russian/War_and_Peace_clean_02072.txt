Boris , grown more manly and looking fresh , rosy and self-possessed , entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle . 
Anna Pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to several persons whom he did not know , giving him a whispered description of each . 
`` Prince Hippolyte Kuragin , M. Krug , the charge d'affaires from Copenhagen -- a profound intellect , '' and simply , `` Mr. Shitov -- a man of great merit '' -- this of the man usually so described . 
Thanks to Anna Mikhaylovna 's efforts , his own tastes , and the peculiarities of his reserved nature , Boris had managed during his service to place himself very advantageously . 
He was aide-de-camp to a very important personage , had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia , and had just returned from there as a special messenger .
