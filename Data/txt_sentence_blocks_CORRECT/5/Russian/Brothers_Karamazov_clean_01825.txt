All my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass judgment on me the same day . 
`` He has disgraced the uniform , '' they said ; `` Let him resign his commission . ''

`` Yes , but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness . '' 
`` If he had been afraid of being shot , he would have shot his own pistol first before asking forgiveness , while he flung it loaded into the forest .
