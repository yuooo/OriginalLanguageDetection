If he had had that design he would , at least , have taken the precaution of arming himself beforehand . 
The brass pestle he caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it . 
Granted that he deceived his father by tapping at the window , granted that he made his way in - I 've said already that I do not for a moment believe that legend , but let it be so , let us suppose it for a moment . 
Gentlemen , I swear to you by all that 's holy , if it had not been his father , but an ordinary enemy , he would , after running through the rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there , have made off , post-haste , without doing any harm to his rival . 
He would have struck him , pushed him away perhaps , nothing more , for he had no thought and no time to spare for that .
