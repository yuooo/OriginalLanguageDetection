`` I am giving life , but I have taken life . '' 
Children came . 
`` How dare I love them , teach and educate them , how can I talk to them of virtue ? 
I have shed blood . '' 
They were splendid children , he longed to caress them ; `` and I ca n't look at their innocent candid faces , I am unworthy . ''
