Met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure , impalpable , and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences , and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanity 's movement . 
The most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are : freedom , equality , enlightenment , progress , civilization , and culture . 
Postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity , the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained : kings , ministers , generals , authors , reformers , popes , and journalists , to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction . 
But as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom , equality , enlightenment , or civilization , and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed , it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate , burn houses , abandon agriculture , and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses , practice agriculture , or slay their fellow creatures . 
History proves this at every turn .
