Tikhon Shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band . 
He was a peasant from Pokrovsk , near the river Gzhat . 
When Denisov had come to Pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French , the elder , as though shielding himself , had replied , as all village elders did , that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them . 
But when Denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the French , and asked if no French had strayed that way , the elder replied that some `` more-orderers '' had really been at their village , but that Tikhon Shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters . 
Denisov had Tikhon called and , having praised him for his activity , said a few words in the elder 's presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country and the hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should cherish .
