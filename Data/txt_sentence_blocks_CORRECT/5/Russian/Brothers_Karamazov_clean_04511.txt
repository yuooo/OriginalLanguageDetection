In the first place that Grigory , who had been intending to take his medicine , might put it off and remain on guard , seeing there was no one to look after the house , and , in the second place , I suppose , that his master seeing that there was no one to guard him , and in terror of a visit from his son , might redouble his vigilance and precaution . 
And , most of all , I suppose that he , Smerdyakov , disabled by the fit , might be carried from the kitchen , where he always slept , apart from all the rest , and where he could go in and out as he liked , to Grigory 's room at the other end of the lodge , where he was always put , shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed . 
This was the immemorial custom established by his master and the kindhearted Marfa Ignatyevna , whenever he had a fit . 
There , lying behind the screen , he would most likely , to keep up the sham , have begun groaning , and so keeping them awake all night -LRB- as Grigory and his wife testified -RRB- . 
And all this , we are to believe , that he might more conveniently get up and murder his master !
