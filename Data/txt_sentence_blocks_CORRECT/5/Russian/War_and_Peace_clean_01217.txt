Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject , she did not stop talking , but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened , and after the soup the prince became more genial .

She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law . 
She was much altered .
