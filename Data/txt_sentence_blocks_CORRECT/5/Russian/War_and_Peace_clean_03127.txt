The two remarkably pretty girls , Natasha and Sonya , with Count Rostov who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time , attracted general attention . 
Moreover , everybody knew vaguely of Natasha 's engagement to Prince Andrew , and knew that the Rostovs had lived in the country ever since , and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one of the best matches in Russia . 
Natasha 's looks , as everyone told her , had improved in the country , and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty . 
She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty , combined with her indifference to everything about her . 
Her black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone , and her delicate arm , bare to above the elbow , lay on the velvet edge of the box , while , evidently unconsciously , she opened and closed her hand in time to the music , crumpling her program .
