`` Uncle 's '' offer was accepted . 
A huntsman was sent to Otradnoe for a trap , while Nicholas rode with Natasha and Petya to `` Uncle 's '' house . 
Some five male domestic serfs , big and little , rushed out to the front porch to meet their master . 
A score of women serfs , old and young , as well as children , popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving . 
The presence of Natasha - a woman , a lady , and on horseback -- raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her , stared her in the face , and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her .
