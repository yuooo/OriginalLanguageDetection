In 1810 he received letters from his parents , in which they told him of Natasha 's engagement to Bolkonski , and that the wedding would be in a year 's time because the old prince made difficulties . 
This letter grieved and mortified Nicholas . 
In the first place he was sorry that Natasha , for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family , should be lost to the home ; and secondly , from his hussar point of view , he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow Bolkonski that connection with him was no such great honor after all , and that if he loved Natasha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father . 
For a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Natasha before she was married , but then came the maneuvers , and considerations about Sonya and about the confusion of their affairs , and Nicholas again put it off . 
But in the spring of that year , he received a letter from his mother , written without his father 's knowledge , and that letter persuaded him to return .
