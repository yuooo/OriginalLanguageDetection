In a neighboring hut lay Raevski 's adjutant with a fractured wrist . 
The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously , and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night . 
He had spent the first night in the same yard as the Rostovs . 
The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning , and at Mytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man . 
In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed , above the high body of a coach standing before the porch , the small glow of another fire .
