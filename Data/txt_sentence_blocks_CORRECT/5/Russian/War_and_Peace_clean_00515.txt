Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart , with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh . 
Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned , as lovers of music do when they hear a false note . 
The two women let go of one another , and then , as if afraid of being too late , seized each other 's hands , kissing them and pulling them away , and again began kissing each other on the face , and then to Prince Andrew 's surprise both began to cry and kissed again . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry . 
Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease , but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry , and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting .
