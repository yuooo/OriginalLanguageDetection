Alone or with the assistance of the prisoner ? 
Let us consider the first alternative - that he did it alone . 
If he had killed him it must have been with some object , for some advantage to himself . 
But not having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder - hatred , jealousy , and so on - Smerdyakov could only have murdered him for the sake of gain , in order to appropriate the three thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope . 
And yet he tells another person - and a person most closely interested , that is , the prisoner - everything about the money and the signals , where the envelope lay , what was written on it , what it was tied up with , and , above all , told him of those signals by which he could enter the house .
