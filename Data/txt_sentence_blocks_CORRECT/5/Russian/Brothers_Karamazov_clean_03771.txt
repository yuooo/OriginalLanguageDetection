`` Rakitin would n't understand it , '' he began in a sort of exaltation ; `` but you , you 'll understand it all . 
That 's why I was thirsting for you . 
You see , there 's so much I 've been wanting to tell you for ever so long , here , within these peeling walls , but I have n't said a word about what matters most ; the moment never seems to have come . 
Now I can wait no longer . 
I must pour out my heart to you .
