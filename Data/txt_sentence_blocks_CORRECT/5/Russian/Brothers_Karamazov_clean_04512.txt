`` But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he might not be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money and the signals to tempt him to commit the murder , and when he had murdered him and had gone away with the money , making a noise , most likely , and waking people , Smerdyakov got up , am I to believe , and went in - what for ? 
To murder his master a second time and carry off the money that had already been stolen ? 
Gentlemen , are you laughing ? 
I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions , but , incredible as it seems , that 's just what the prisoner alleges . 
When he had left the house , had knocked Grigory down and raised an alarm , he tells us Smerdyakov got up , went in and murdered his master and stole the money !
