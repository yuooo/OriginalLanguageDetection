Dolokhov was of medium height , with curly hair and light-blue eyes . 
He was about twenty-five . 
Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache , so that his mouth , the most striking feature of his face , was clearly seen . 
The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved . 
The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one , and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth ; this , together with the resolute , insolent intelligence of his eyes , produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face .
