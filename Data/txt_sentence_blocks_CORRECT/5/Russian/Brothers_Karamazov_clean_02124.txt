` He despises me , ' I thought ; ` he wo n't even look at me . ' 
And I felt it so much at last that I wondered at myself for being so frightened of a boy .

I was full of spite and anger . 
Would you believe it , nobody here dares talk or think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil purpose .
