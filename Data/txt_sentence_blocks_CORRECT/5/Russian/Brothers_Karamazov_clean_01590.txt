And as man can not bear to be without the miraculous , he will create new miracles of his own for himself , and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft , though he might be a hundred times over a rebel , heretic and infidel . 
Thou didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee , mocking and reviling Thee , `` Come down from the cross and we will believe that Thou art He . '' 
Thou didst not come down , for again Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle , and didst crave faith given freely , not based on miracle . 
Thou didst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has overawed him for ever . 
But Thou didst think too highly of men therein , for they are slaves , of course , though rebellious by nature .
