The fourth column , with which Kutuzov was , stood on the Pratzen Heights . 
Below , where the fight was beginning , there was still thick fog ; on the higher ground it was clearing , but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front . 
Whether all the enemy forces were , as we supposed , six miles away , or whether they were near by in that sea of mist , no one knew till after eight o'clock . 
It was nine o'clock in the morning . 
The fog lay unbroken like a sea down below , but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood with his marshals around him , it was quite light .
