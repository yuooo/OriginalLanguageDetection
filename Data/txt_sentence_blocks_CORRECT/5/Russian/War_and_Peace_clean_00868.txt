Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him . 
He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities , avoid doing certain things , and speak French . 
He was one of those , who , liking work , knew how to do it , and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table . 
He worked well whatever the import of his work . 
It was not the question `` What for ? ''
