The presence and remarks of Willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre 's pleasure . 
Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality -- the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original , peculiar , and unique people . 
He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him -- an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to nothing -- and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him . 
It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurrying : some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish , larvae , and corpses , others back to the heap , or why they jostle , overtake one another , and fight , and it would be equally difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow . 
But when we watch the ants round their ruined heap , the tenacity , energy , and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction of the heap , something indestructible , which though intangible is the real strength of the colony , still exists ; and similarly , though in Moscow in the month of October there was no government no churches , shrines , riches , or houses -- it was still the Moscow it had been in August .
