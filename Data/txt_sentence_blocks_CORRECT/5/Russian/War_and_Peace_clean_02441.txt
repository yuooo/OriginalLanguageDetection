Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law , Pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph Alexeevich . 
This is what he noted in his diary : Moscow , 17th November I have just returned from my benefactor , and hasten to write down what I have experienced . 
Joseph Alexeevich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder . 
No one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint . 
From morning till late at night , except when he eats his very plain food , he is working at science .
