`` To them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon . 
For me tomorrow means this : a Russian army of a hundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight , and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win . 
And if you like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make , we shall win tomorrow 's battle . 
Tomorrow , happen what may , we shall win ! '' 
`` There now , your excellency !
