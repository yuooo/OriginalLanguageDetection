I am her father . '' 
Six weeks after Anna Pavlovna 's `` At Home '' and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry Helene would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away , Pierre , despite that decision , had not left Prince Vasili 's and felt with terror that in people 's eyes he was every day more and more connected with her , that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her , that he could not break away from her , and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers . 
He might perhaps have been able to free himself but that Prince Vasili -LRB- who had rarely before given receptions -RRB- now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone 's expectation . 
Prince Vasili , in the rare moments when he was at home , would take Pierre 's hand in passing and draw it downwards , or absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled , clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say : `` Till tomorrow , '' or , `` Be in to dinner or I shall not see you , '' or , `` I am staying in for your sake , '' and so on .
