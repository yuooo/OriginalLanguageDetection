Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked . 
With others Balaga bargained , charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours ' drive , and rarely drove himself , generally letting his young men do so . 
But with `` his gentlemen '' he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work . 
Only a couple of times a year -- when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand -- he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him . 
The gentlemen always made him sit down .
