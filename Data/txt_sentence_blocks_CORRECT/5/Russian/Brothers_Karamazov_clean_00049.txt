Alyosha went to live in the house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch , ladies whom he had never seen before . 
On what terms she lived with them he did not know himself . 
It was very characteristic of him , indeed , that he never cared at whose expense he was living . 
In that respect he was a striking contrast to his elder brother Ivan , who struggled with poverty for his first two years in the university , maintained himself by his own efforts , and had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his benefactor . 
But this strange trait in Alyosha 's character must not , I think , criticised too severely , for at the slightest acquaintance with him anyone would have perceived that Alyosha was one of those youths , almost of the type of religious enthusiast , who , if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large fortune , would not hesitate to give it away for the asking , either for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue .
