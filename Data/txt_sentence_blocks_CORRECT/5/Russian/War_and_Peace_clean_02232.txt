As no transports could arrive , the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages , searching for potatoes , but found few even of these . 
Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled -- if any remained , they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken from them ; even the soldiers , usually pitiless enough , instead of taking anything from them , often gave them the last of their rations . 
The Pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action , but had lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness . 
In the hospitals , death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever , or the swelling that came from bad food , preferred to remain on duty , and hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals . 
When spring came on , the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked like asparagus , which , for some reason , they called `` Mashka 's sweet root . ''
