Two days before her death , he had run away , staying no one knew where in the town . 
The day after the murder , he was found on the road leading out of the town , dead drunk , with a knife in his pocket , and his right hand happened to be stained with blood . 
He declared that his nose had been bleeding , but no one believed him .
