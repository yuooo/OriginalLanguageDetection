It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach , but even in this room there now stood an empty bath , and water had been spilled on the carpet . 
They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them . 
They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre , with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory , with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great . 
The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before , whispering to one another . 
All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna Mikhaylovna as she entered , and at the big stout figure of Pierre who , hanging his head , meekly followed her .
