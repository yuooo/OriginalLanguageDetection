This power can not be based on the predominance of moral strength , for , not to mention heroes such as Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely , history shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich , who ruled over millions of people , had any particular moral qualities , but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over . 
If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it , it must evidently be looked for elsewhere -- in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power . 
And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence , that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history 's understanding of power for true gold . 
Power is the collective will of the people transferred , by expressed or tacit consent , to their chosen rulers . 
In the domain of jurisprudence , which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged , it is all very clear ; but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation .
