Alpatych , who had reached Bogucharovo shortly before the old prince 's death , noticed an agitation among the peasants , and that contrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district , where over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks , the peasants in the steppe region round Bogucharovo were , it was rumored , in touch with the French , received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand , and did not migrate . 
He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp , who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport , had returned with news that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages , but that the French did not harm them . 
Alpatych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the village of Visloukhovo , which was occupied by the French , a proclamation by a French general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants , and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them . 
As proof of this the peasant had brought from Visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes -LRB- he did not know that they were false -RRB- paid to him in advance for hay . 
More important still , Alpatych learned that on the morning of the very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the princess ' luggage from Bogucharovo , there had been a village meeting at which it had been decided not to move but to wait .
