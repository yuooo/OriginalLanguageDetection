There was only one hut available for the regimental commander . 
The commander rode up to his hut . 
The regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts . 
Like some huge many-limbed animal , the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food . 
One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village , and immediately the sound of axes and swords , the crashing of branches , and merry voices could be heard from there .
