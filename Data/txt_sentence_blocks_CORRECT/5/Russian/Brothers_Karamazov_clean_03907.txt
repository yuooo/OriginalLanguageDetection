`` I fell from the garret just in the same way a year ago . 
It 's quite true you ca n't tell the day and hour of a fit beforehand , but you can always have a presentiment of it . '' 
`` But you did foretell the day and the hour ! '' 
`` In regard to my epilepsy , sir , you had much better inquire of the doctors here . 
You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham ; it 's no use my saying any more about it . ''
