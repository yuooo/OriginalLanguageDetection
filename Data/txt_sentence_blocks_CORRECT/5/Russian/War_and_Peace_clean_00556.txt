The little princess was in her sister-in-law 's room . 
Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him . 
After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in , he ordered the horses to be harnessed . 
Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room ; a small box , a large canteen fitted with silver plate , two Turkish pistols and a saber -- a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochakov . 
All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew 's were in very good order : new , clean , and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes .
