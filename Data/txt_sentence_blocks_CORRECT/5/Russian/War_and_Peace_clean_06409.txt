For history , lines exist of the movement of human wills , one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of man 's will in the present moves in space , time , and dependence on cause . 
The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes , the more evident are the laws of that movement . 
To discover and define those laws is the problem of history . 
From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows , seeking the causes of events in man 's freewill , a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible , for however man 's free will may be restricted , as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law , the existence of law becomes impossible . 
Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal , that is , by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity , can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes , and then instead of seeking causes , history will take the discovery of laws as its problem .
