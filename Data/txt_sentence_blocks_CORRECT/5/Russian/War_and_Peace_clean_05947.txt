Government clerks set up their baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms . 
The higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods left behind by the French . 
The owners of houses in which much property had been left , brought there from other houses , complained of the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin ; others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different houses into this or that house , it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was found there . 
They abused the police and bribed them , made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had perished in the fire , and demanded relief . 
And Count Rostopchin wrote proclamations .
