The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French . 
The road the French would take was unknown , and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover . 
Only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French . 
All the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches , whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches . 
To that end Kutuzov 's activity was directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to Vilna -- not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it .
