`` Yes , yes ! 
There they are , those false images that agitated , enraptured , and tormented me , '' said he to himself , passing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception of death . 
`` There they are , those rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious . 
Glory , the good of society , love of a woman , the Fatherland itself -- how important these pictures appeared to me , with what profound meaning they seemed to be filled ! 
And it is all so simple , pale , and crude in the cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me . ''
