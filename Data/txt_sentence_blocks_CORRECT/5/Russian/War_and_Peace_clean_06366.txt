When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it , when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently . 
But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement . 
Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed . 
Wherever the ship may go , the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it , and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship 's movement also . 
Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which , as commands , were related to events , historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands .
