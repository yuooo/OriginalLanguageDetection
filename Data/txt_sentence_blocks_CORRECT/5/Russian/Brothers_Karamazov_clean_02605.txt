And as ill-luck would have it , to set things right , I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron , how he was not accepted into the French Academy , and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph : Ci-git Piron qui ne fut rien , Pas meme academicien , * * Here lies Piron , who was nothing , not even an Academician . 
They seized me and thrashed me . ''
