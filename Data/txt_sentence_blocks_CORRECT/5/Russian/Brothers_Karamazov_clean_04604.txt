If the envelope on the floor may be taken as evidence that there had been money in it , why may I not maintain the opposite , that the envelope was on the floor because the money had been taken from it by its owner ? 
`` But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch took it out of the envelope since it was not found when the police searched the house ? 
In the first place , part of the money was found in the cash-box , and secondly , he might have taken it out that morning or the evening before to make some other use of it , to give or send it away ; he may have changed his idea , his plan of action completely , without thinking it necessary to announce the fact to Smerdyakov beforehand . 
And if there is the barest possibility of such an explanation , how can the prisoner be so positively accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery , and of having actually carried out that robbery ? 
This is encroaching on the domain of romance .
