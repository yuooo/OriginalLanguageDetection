Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow . 
How horrified he would have been seven years before , when he first arrived from abroad , had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or plan anything , that his rut had long been shaped , eternally predetermined , and that wriggle as he might , he would be what all in his position were . 
He could not have believed it ! 
Had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia ; then himself to be a Napoleon ; then to be a philosopher ; and then a strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon ? 
Had he not seen the possibility of , and passionately desired , the regeneration of the sinful human race , and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection ?
