Let me tell you , too , the old man , your father , is standing in Mitya 's way now . 
He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka . 
His mouth waters at the sight of her . 
It 's simply on her account he made that scene in the cell just now , simply because Miusov called her an ` abandoned creature . ' 
He 's worse than a tom-cat in love .
