As you know , I am quite indifferent to politics , but from my father 's remarks and his talks with Michael Ivanovich I know all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte , who only at Bald Hills in the whole world , it seems , is not accepted as a great man , still less as Emperor of France . 
And my father can not stand this . 
It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow ; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody . 
All the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable . 
In any case it will be decided very shortly .
