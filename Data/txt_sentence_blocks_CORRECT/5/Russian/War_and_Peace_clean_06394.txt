Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world , the greater or lesser remoteness of time , and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a man 's life . 
So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known , where the time between the action and its examination is great , and where the causes of the action are most accessible , we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will . 
If we examine a man little dependent on external conditions , whose action was performed very recently , and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken , we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom . 
In neither case -- however we may change our point of view , however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world , however inaccessible it may be to us , however long or short the period of time , however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be -- can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity . 
-LRB- 1 -RRB- To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the influence of the external world , we never get a conception of freedom in space .
