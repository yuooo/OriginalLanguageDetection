`` As for us , Count , we get along on our pay . 
I can tell you for myself ... '' `` I say , Berg , my dear fellow , '' said Rostov , `` when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with , and I happen to be there , I 'll go at once , to be out of your way ! 
Do go somewhere , anywhere ... to the devil ! '' 
he exclaimed , and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face , evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words , he added , `` Do n't be hurt , my dear fellow ; you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance . ''
