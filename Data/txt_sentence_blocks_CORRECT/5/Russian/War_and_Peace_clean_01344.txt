Rostov had not yet had time to get his uniform . 
He had on a shabby cadet jacket , decorated with a soldier 's cross , equally shabby cadet 's riding breeches lined with worn leather , and an officer 's saber with a sword knot . 
The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign , and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head . 
As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Boris and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance -- that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire . 
The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip , parading their cleanliness and discipline .
