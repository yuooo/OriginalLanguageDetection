To this letter the old prince had replied affectionately , and from that time had kept the Frenchwoman at a distance . 
Prince Andrew 's second letter , written near Vitebsk after the French had occupied that town , gave a brief account of the whole campaign , enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war . 
In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills , so near the theater of war and on the army 's direct line of march , and advised him to move to Moscow . 
At dinner that day , on Dessalles ' mentioning that the French were said to have already entered Vitebsk , the old prince remembered his son 's letter . 
`` There was a letter from Prince Andrew today , '' he said to Princess Mary -- `` Have n't you read it ? ''
