The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raevski 's Redoubt , and to the French as la grande redoute , la fatale redoute , la redoute du centre , around which tens of thousands fell , and which the French regarded as the key to the whole position . 
This redoubt consisted of a knoll , on three sides of which trenches had been dug . 
Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired through openings in the earthwork . 
In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired incessantly . 
A little behind the guns stood infantry .
