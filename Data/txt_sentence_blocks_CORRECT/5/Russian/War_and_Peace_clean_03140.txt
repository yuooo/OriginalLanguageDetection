The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards , at the sides was some painted cardboard representing trees , and at the back was a cloth stretched over boards . 
In the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts . 
One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench , to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was glued . 
They all sang something . 
When they had finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter 's box and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs , and holding a plume and a dagger , went up to her and began singing , waving his arms about .
