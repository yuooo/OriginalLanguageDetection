The prisoner said that the troops that had entered Forminsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army , that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four days previously . 
That same evening a house serf who had come from Borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town . 
Some Cossacks of Dokhturov 's detachment reported having sighted the French Guards marching along the road to Borovsk . 
From all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected direction -- along the Kaluga road . 
Dokhturov was unwilling to undertake any action , as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do .
