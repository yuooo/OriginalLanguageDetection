At times , as if to allow them a respite , a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead , but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded carried off .

All alike were taciturn and morose . 
Talk was rarely heard in the ranks , and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of `` stretchers ! ''
