Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy -- of the look Platon had given him as he sat under the tree , of the shot heard from that spot , of the dog 's howl , of the guilty faces of the two Frenchmen as they ran past him , of the lowered and smoking gun , and of Karataev 's absence at this halt -- and he was on the point of realizing that Karataev had been killed , but just at that instant , he knew not why , the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev . 
And without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them , Pierre closed his eyes , seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid , vibrating globe , and he sank into water so that it closed over his head . 
Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing . 
French soldiers were running past him . 
`` The Cossacks ! ''
