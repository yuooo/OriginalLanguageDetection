The count burst out laughing . 
The other guests seeing that Shinshin was talking came up to listen . 
Berg , oblivious of irony or indifference , continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps ; how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he , as senior in the company , might easily succeed to the post ; how popular he was with everyone in the regiment , and how satisfied his father was with him . 
Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this , and did not seem to suspect that others , too , might have their own interests . 
But all he said was so prettily sedate , and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious , that he disarmed his hearers .
