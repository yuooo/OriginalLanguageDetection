`` I will tell you instead , gentlemen , another interesting and rather characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself . 
Only five days ago , in a gathering here , principally of ladies , he solemnly declared in argument that there was nothing in the whole world to make men love their neighbours . 
That there was no law of nature that man should love mankind , and that , if there had been any love on earth hitherto , it was not owing to a natural law , but simply because men have believed in immortality . 
Ivan Fyodorovitch added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in that faith , and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in immortality , not only love but every living force maintaining the life of the world would at once be dried up . 
Moreover , nothing then would be immoral , everything would be lawful , even cannibalism .
