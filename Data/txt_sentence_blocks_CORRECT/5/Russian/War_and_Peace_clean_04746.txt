Having reached the Patriarch 's Ponds Pierre found the Bazdeevs ' house , where he had not been for a long time past . 
He went up to the gate . 
Gerasim , that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzhok five years before with Joseph Bazdeev , came out in answer to his knock . 
`` At home ? '' 
asked Pierre .
