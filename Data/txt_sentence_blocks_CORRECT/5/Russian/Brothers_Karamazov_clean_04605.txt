If it is maintained that something has been stolen , the thing must be produced , or at least its existence must be proved beyond doubt . 
Yet no one had ever seen these notes . 
`` Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen , hardly more than a boy , who carried on a small business as a costermonger , went in broad daylight into a moneychanger 's shop with an axe , and with extraordinary , typical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteen hundred roubles . 
Five hours later he was arrested , and , except fifteen roubles he had already managed to spend , the whole sum was found on him . 
Moreover , the shopman , on his return to the shop after the murder , informed the police not only of the exact sum stolen , but even of the notes and gold coins of which that sum was made up , and those very notes and coins were found on the criminal .
