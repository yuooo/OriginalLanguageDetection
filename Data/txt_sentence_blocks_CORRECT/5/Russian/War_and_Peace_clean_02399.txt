While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances , particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need . 
In Petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle , when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future , on which the fate of millions depended , was being shaped . 
From the irritation of the older men , the curiosity of the uninitiated , the reserve of the initiated , the hurry and preoccupation of everyone , and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned every day , he felt that now , in 1809 , here in Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation , the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know , but who was supposed to be a man of genius -- Speranski . 
And this movement of reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea , and Speranski its chief promoter , began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness . 
Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day .
