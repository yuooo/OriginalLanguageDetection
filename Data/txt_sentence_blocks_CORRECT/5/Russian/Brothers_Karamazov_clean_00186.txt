Father Zossima stood on the top step , put on his stole , and began blessing the women who thronged about him . 
One crazy woman was led up to him . 
As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth . 
Laying the stole on her forehead , he read a short prayer over her , and she was at once soothed and quieted . 
I do not know how it may be now , but in my childhood I often happened to see and hear these `` possessed '' women in the villages and monasteries .
