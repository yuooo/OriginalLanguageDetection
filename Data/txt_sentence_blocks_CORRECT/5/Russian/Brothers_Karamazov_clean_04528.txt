I ask you , gentlemen , would Smerdyakov have behaved in that way ? 
Would he have left the envelope on the floor ? 
`` No , this was the action of a frantic murderer , a murderer who was not a thief and had never stolen before that day , who snatched the notes from under the pillow , not like a thief stealing them , but as though seizing his own property from the thief who had stolen it . 
For that was the idea which had become almost an insane obsession in Dmitri Karamazov in regard to that money . 
And pouncing upon the envelope , which he had never seen before , he tore it open to make sure whether the money was in it , and ran away with the money in his pocket , even forgetting to consider that he had left an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope on the floor .
