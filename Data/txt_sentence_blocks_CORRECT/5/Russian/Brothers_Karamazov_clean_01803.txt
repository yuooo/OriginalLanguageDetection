I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble and lofty character , the daughter of people much respected . 
They were well-to-do people of influence and position . 
They always gave me a cordial and friendly reception . 
I fancied that the young lady looked on me with favour and my heart was aflame at such an idea . 
Later on I saw and fully realised that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all , but only recognised the elevation of her mind and character , which I could not indeed have helped doing .
