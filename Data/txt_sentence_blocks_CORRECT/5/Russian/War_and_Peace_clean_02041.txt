`` In token of generosity I ask you to give me all your valuables . '' 
`` But I have nothing here , '' replied Pierre , supposing that he was asked to give up all he possessed . 
`` What you have with you : watch , money , rings ... '' Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch , but could not manage for some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger . 
When that had been done , the Rhetor said : `` In token of obedience , I ask you to undress . '' 
Pierre took off his coat , waistcoat , and left boot according to the Rhetor 's instructions .
