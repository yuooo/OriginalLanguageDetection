This soldier had been taken prisoner in some remote part of Asia , and was threatened with an immediate agonising death if he did not renounce Christianity and follow Islam . 
He refused to deny his faith , and was tortured , flayed alive , and died , praising and glorifying Christ . 
Grigory had related the story at table . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch always liked , over the dessert after dinner , to laugh and talk , if only with Grigory . 
This afternoon he was in a particularly good-humoured and expansive mood .
