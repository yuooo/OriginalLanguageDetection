And it is of this period of the campaign -- when the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats , was short of provisions and without vodka , and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost , when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline can not be maintained , when men were taken into that region of death where discipline fails , not for a few hours only as in a battle , but for months , where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and cold , when half the army perished in a single month -- it is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us how Miloradovich should have made a flank march to such and such a place , Tormasov to another place , and Chichagov should have crossed -LRB- more than knee-deep in snow -RRB- to somewhere else , and how so-and-so `` routed '' and `` cut off '' the French and so on and so on . 
The Russians , half of whom died , did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation , and they are not to blame because other Russians , sitting in warm rooms , proposed that they should do what was impossible . 
All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals , and not the history of the events . 
To them the words of Miloradovich seem very interesting , and so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received ; but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them , for it does not come within the range of their investigation . 
Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the events , and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution .
