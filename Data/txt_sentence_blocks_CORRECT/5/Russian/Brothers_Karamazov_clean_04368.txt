There was a wave of sympathy for Mitya . 
As for him ... . 
I was told that once or twice , while Katerina Ivanovna was giving her evidence , he jumped up from his seat , sank back again , and hid his face in his hands . 
But when she had finished , he suddenly cried in a sobbing voice : `` Katya , why have you ruined me ? '' 
and his sobs were audible all over the court .
