I say nothing about medicine : science , I am told , may go astray : the doctors were not able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the real . 
That may be so , but answer me one question : what motive had he for such a counterfeit ? 
Could he , had he been plotting the murder , have desired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit just before ? 
`` You see , gentlemen of the jury , on the night of the murder , there were five persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch 's - Fyodor Pavlovitch himself -LRB- but he did not kill himself , that 's evident -RRB- ; then his servant , Grigory , but he was almost killed himself ; the third person was Grigory 's wife , Marfa Ignatyevna , but it would be simply shameful to imagine her murdering her master . 
Two persons are left - the prisoner and Smerdyakov .
