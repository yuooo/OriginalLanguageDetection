Then a gypsy comes along and he , too , tries : The gypsy came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
But they could n't love the gypsy either : He would be a thief , I fear , And would cause me many a tear . 
And many more men come to try their luck , among them a soldier : The soldier came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
But the soldier is rejected with contempt , in two indecent lines , sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience .
