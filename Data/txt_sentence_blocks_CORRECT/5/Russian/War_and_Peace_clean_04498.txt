The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others , though there is and can be no beginning to any event , for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another . 
The second method is to consider the actions of some one man -- a king or a commander -- as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills ; whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage . 
Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination . 
But however small the units it takes , we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others , or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon , or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage , is in itself false . 
It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history .
