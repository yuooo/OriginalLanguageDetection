If so much has been and still is written about the Berezina , on the French side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory , and on the Russian side merely because in Petersburg -- far from the seat of war -- a plan -LRB- again one of Pfuel 's -RRB- had been devised to catch Napoleon in a strategic trap at the Berezina River . 
Everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan , and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the Berezina that destroyed the French army . 
In reality the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the French -- in guns and men lost -- than Krasnoe had been , as the figures show . 
The sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the enemy 's retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action -- the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the army demanded -- namely , simply to follow the enemy up . 
The French crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal .
