At the end of August the Rostovs received another letter from Nicholas . 
He wrote from the province of Voronezh where he had been sent to procure remounts , but that letter did not set the countess at ease . 
Knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about Petya . 
Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostovs ' acquaintances had left Moscow , and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible , she would not bear of leaving before her treasure , her adored Petya , returned . 
On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived .
