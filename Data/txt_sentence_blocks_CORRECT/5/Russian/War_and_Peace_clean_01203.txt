`` Do you hear how he 's walking ? '' 
said Tikhon , drawing the architect 's attention to the sound of the prince 's footsteps . 
`` Stepping flat on his heels -- we know what that means ... '' However , at nine o'clock the prince , in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap , went out for his usual walk . 
It had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse , along which the prince was in the habit of walking , had been swept : the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path . 
The prince went through the conservatories , the serfs ' quarters , and the outbuildings , frowning and silent .
