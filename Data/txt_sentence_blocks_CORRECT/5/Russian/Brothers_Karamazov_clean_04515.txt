A weighty question , truly ! 
And the facts to confirm it are astounding . 
One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit , apparently to arouse suspicion in everyone , alarm in his master and alarm in Grigory . 
It would be interesting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane plan . 
`` But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov 's part , but only of passive acquiescence ; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder , and foreseeing that he would be blamed for letting his master be murdered , without screaming for help or resisting , he may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by shamming a fit - ` you may murder him as you like ; it 's nothing to me .
