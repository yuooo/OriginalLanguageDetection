The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses , from which wounded men began to come into the Rostovs ' yard . 
Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things . 
But the work of unloading , once started , could not be arrested . 
It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind . 
Cases full of china , bronzes , pictures , and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard , and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart .
