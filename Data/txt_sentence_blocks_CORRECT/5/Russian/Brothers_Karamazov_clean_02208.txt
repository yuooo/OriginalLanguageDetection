Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance , and being ready to take his bride , so to speak , from the hands of her protector , Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy . 
I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka 's past as something completely over . 
He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervour of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him , it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri , free from every vice . 
They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh . 
As for Kuzma Samsonov , Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka 's , though she had never loved him , and who was now himself a thing of the past , completely done with , and , so to say , non-existent .
