Anna Pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees as before -- such as she alone had the gift of arranging -- at which was to be found `` the cream of really good society , the bloom of the intellectual essence of Petersburg , '' as she herself put it .

The `` cream of really good society '' consisted of the fascinating Helene , forsaken by her husband , Mortemart , the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had just returned from Vienna , two diplomatists , the old aunt , a young man referred to in that drawing room as `` a man of great merit '' -LRB- un homme de beaucoup de merite -RRB- , a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother , and several other less noteworthy persons .
