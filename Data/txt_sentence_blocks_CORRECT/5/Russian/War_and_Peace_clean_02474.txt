I saw that I was in Moscow in my house , in the big sitting room , and Joseph Alexeevich came in from the drawing room . 
I seemed to know at once that the process of regeneration had already taken place in him , and I rushed to meet him . 
I embraced him and kissed his hands , and he said , `` Hast thou noticed that my face is different ? '' 
I looked at him , still holding him in my arms , and saw that his face was young , but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed . 
And I said , `` I should have known you had I met you by chance , '' and I thought to myself , `` Am I telling the truth ? ''
