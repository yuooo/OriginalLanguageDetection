The soldiers , swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously , marched with long steps . 
Behind the company the sound of wheels , the creaking of springs , and the tramp of horses ' hoofs were heard . 
Kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town . 
The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease , and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men . 
In the second file from the right flank , beside which the carriage passed the company , a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice .
