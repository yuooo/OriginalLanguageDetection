The plague does not touch him . 
The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault . 
His childishly rash , uncalled-for , and ignoble departure from Africa , leaving his comrades in distress , is set down to his credit , and again the enemy 's fleet twice lets him slip past . 
When , intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully , he reaches Paris , the dissolution of the republican government , which a year earlier might have ruined him , has reached its extreme limit , and his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to exalt him -- and though he himself has no plan , he is quite ready for his new role . 
He had no plan , he was afraid of everything , but the parties snatched at him and demanded his participation .
