Since he has openly abandoned his betrothed for her , he does n't despise her . 
There 's something here , my dear boy , that you do n't understand yet . 
A man will fall in love with some beauty , with a woman 's body , or even with a part of a woman 's body -LRB- a sensualist can understand that -RRB- , and he 'll abandon his own children for her , sell his father and mother , and his country , Russia , too . 
If he 's honest , he 'll steal ; if he 's humane , he 'll murder ; if he 's faithful , he 'll deceive . 
Pushkin , the poet of women 's feet , sung of their feet in his verse .
