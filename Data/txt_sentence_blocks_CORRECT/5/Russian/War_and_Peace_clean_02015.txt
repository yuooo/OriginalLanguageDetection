Bazdeev had been one of the best-known Freemasons and Martinists , even in Novikov 's time . 
For a long while after he had gone , Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room , pondering over his vicious past , and with a rapturous sense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful , irreproachable , virtuous future that seemed to him so easy . 
It seemed to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous . 
Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul . 
He firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue , and that is how Freemasonry presented itself to him .
