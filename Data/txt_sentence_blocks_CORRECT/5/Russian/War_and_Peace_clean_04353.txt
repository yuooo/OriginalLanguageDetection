thought Pierre , and followed the general . 
The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him . 
Pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses and , asking which was the quietest , clambered onto it , seized it by the mane , and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and , feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins , he galloped after the general , causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll . 
Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left , and Pierre , losing sight of him , galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him . 
He tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left , but there were soldiers everywhere , all with expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task .
