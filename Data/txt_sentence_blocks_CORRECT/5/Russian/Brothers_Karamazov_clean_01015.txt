`` Among them ? 
Among whom ? '' 
asked the monk , timidly . 
`` I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year , I have n't been since . 
I saw a devil sitting on one man 's chest hiding under his cassock , only his horns poked out ; another had one peeping out of his pocket with such sharp eyes , he was afraid of me ; another settled in the unclean belly of one , another was hanging round a man 's neck , and so he was carrying him about without seeing him .
