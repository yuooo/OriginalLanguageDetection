On receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode , who was in attendance on him , to the enemy camp . 
Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation , and meanwhile Kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim road . 
Bagration 's exhausted and hungry detachment , which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army , had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself . 
Kutuzov 's expectations that the proposals of capitulation -LRB- which were in no way binding -RRB- might give time for part of the transport to pass , and also that Murat 's mistake would very soon be discovered , proved correct . 
As soon as Bonaparte -LRB- who was at Schonbrunn , sixteen miles from Hollabrunn -RRB- received Murat 's dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation , he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat : Schonbrunn , 25th Brumaire , 1805 , at eight o'clock in the morning To PRINCE MURAT , I can not find words to express to you my displeasure .
