The old count felt this most . 
He would probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment , but it resulted from the state of his affairs . 
He did not know at all how much he had , what his debts amounted to , or what dowry he could give Vera . 
When his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them , for her dowry , an estate with three hundred serfs ; but one of these estates had already been sold , and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be sold , so that it was impossible to give it to Vera . 
Nor had he any money .
