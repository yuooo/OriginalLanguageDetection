The roar of guns , the whistling of projectiles , and the piteous moaning of the cook , which rose above the other sounds , did not cease for a moment . 
The mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in the street . 
A shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral , whence they were fetching the wonder-working icon of Smolensk . 
Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside . 
Alpatych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway .
