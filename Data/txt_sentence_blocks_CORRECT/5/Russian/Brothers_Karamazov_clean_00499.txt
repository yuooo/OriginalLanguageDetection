Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha 's arrival . 
Alyosha `` pierced his heart '' by `` living with him , seeing everything and blaming nothing . '' 
Moreover , Alyosha brought with him something his father had never known before : a complete absence of contempt for him and an invariable kindness , a perfectly natural unaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little . 
All this was a complete surprise to the old profligate , who had dropped all family ties . 
It was a new and surprising experience for him , who had till then loved nothing but `` evil . ''
