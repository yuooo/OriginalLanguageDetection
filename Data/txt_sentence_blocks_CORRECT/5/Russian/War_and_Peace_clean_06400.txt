-LRB- 3 -RRB- However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action , we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless , and so again we never reach absolute inevitability . 
But besides this , even if , admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero , we assumed in some given case -- as for instance in that of a dying man , an unborn babe , or an idiot -- complete absence of freedom , by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining , for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man . 
And so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man 's completely free action . 
And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom , we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations , an infinitely long period of time , and an infinite series of causes . 
To imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability , we must imagine him all alone , beyond space , beyond time , and free from dependence on cause .
