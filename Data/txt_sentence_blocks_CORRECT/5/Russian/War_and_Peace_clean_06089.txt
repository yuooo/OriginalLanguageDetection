The countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and , unable to realize how hard it was for her son , kept demanding now a carriage -LRB- which they did not keep -RRB- to send for a friend , now some expensive article of food for herself , or wine for her son , or money to buy a present as a surprise for Natasha or Sonya , or for Nicholas himself . 
Sonya kept house , attended on her aunt , read to her , put up with her whims and secret ill-will , and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess . 
Nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to Sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and devotion , but tried to keep aloof from her . 
He seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect , and because there was nothing to reproach her with . 
She had all that people are valued for , but little that could have made him love her .
