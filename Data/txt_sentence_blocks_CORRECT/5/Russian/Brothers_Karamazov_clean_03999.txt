Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa , wearing the same dressing-gown . 
The table had been brought out in front of the sofa , so that there was hardly room to move . 
On the table lay a thick book in yellow cover , but Smerdyakov was not reading it . 
He seemed to be sitting doing nothing . 
He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze , and was apparently not at all surprised at his coming .
