The sick soldier , Sokolov , pale and thin with dark shadows round his eyes , alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed . 
His eyes , prominent from the emaciation of his face , gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention to him , and he moaned regularly and quietly . 
It was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him to moan -LRB- he had dysentery -RRB- as his fear and grief at being left alone . 
Pierre , girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karataev had made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with , went up to the sick man and squatted down beside him . 
`` You know , Sokolov , they are not all going away !
