Sonya ran away , but Natasha , taking her brother 's arm , led him into the sitting room , where they began talking . 
They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves .

`` Oh , how nice , how splendid ! '' 
she said to everything .
