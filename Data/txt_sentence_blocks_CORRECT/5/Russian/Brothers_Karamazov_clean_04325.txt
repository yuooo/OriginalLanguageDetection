`` As to the opinion of my learned colleague , '' the Moscow doctor added ironically in conclusion `` that the prisoner would , entering the court , have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him , I will only say that , apart from the playfulness of this theory , it is radically unsound . 
For though I fully agree that the prisoner , on entering the court where his fate will be decided , would not naturally look straight before him in that fixed way , and that that may really be a sign of his abnormal mental condition , at the same time I maintain that he would naturally not look to the left at the ladies , but , on the contrary , to the right to find his legal adviser , on whose help all his hopes rest and on whose defence all his future depends . '' 
The doctor expressed his opinion positively and emphatically . 
But the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts . 
In his opinion the prisoner was now , and had been all along , in a perfectly normal condition , and , although he certainly must have been in a nervous and exceedingly excited state before his arrest , this might have been due to several perfectly obvious causes , jealousy , anger , continual drunkenness , and so on .
