If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples , the first question -- in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible -- is : what is the power that moves peoples ? 
To this , modern history laboriously replies either that Napoleon was a great genius , or that Louis XIV was very proud , or that certain writers wrote certain books . 
All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it , but it is not what was asked . 
All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through Napoleons , Louis-es , and writers ; but we do not acknowledge such a power , and therefore before speaking about Napoleons , Louis-es , and authors , we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations . 
If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared , it should be explained in what this new force consists , for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force .
