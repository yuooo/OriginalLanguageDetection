At one end of the table , the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately , at which she laughed ; at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some Mary Viktorovna or other . 
At the center of the table , Prince Vasili attracted everybody 's attention . 
With a facetious smile on his face , he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday 's meeting of the Imperial Council , at which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmitinov , the new military governor general of Petersburg , had received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergey Kuzmich , in which the Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the people 's loyalty , that the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure , and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it . 
This rescript began with the words : `` Sergey Kuzmich , From all sides reports reach me , '' etc. `` Well , and so he never got farther than : ` Sergey Kuzmich ' ? '' 
asked one of the ladies .
