What is the meaning of that great word ? 
What is the great idea in that name ? 
We have just indicated in part what a true father is and what he ought to be . 
In the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts are aching - in the present case , the father , Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov , did not correspond to that conception of a father to which we have just referred . 
That 's the misfortune .
