The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must admit that conclusion , and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor , devotion , and so forth , must reluctantly admit that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for Napoleon and defeats for Kutuzov . 
But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a conclusion involves a contradiction , since the series of French victories brought the French complete destruction , while the series of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country . 
The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals , from memoirs , reports , projects , and so forth , have attributed to this last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed , namely that of cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army . 
There never was or could have been such an aim , for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible . 
It would have been senseless , first because Napoleon 's disorganized army was flying from Russia with all possible speed , that is to say , was doing just what every Russian desired .
