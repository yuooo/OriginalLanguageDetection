Remembering them , how could he be fully happy with those new ones , however dear the new ones might be ? 
But he could , he could . 
It 's the great mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet , tender joy . 
The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous blood of youth . 
I bless the rising sun each day , and , as before , my heart sings to meet it , but now I love even more its setting , its long slanting rays and the soft , tender , gentle memories that come with them , the dear images from the whole of my long , happy life - and over all the Divine Truth , softening , reconciling , forgiving !
