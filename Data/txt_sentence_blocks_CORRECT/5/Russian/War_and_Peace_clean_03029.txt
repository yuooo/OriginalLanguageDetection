One day in Moscow in Princess Mary 's presence -LRB- she thought her father did it purposely when she was there -RRB- the old prince kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne 's hand and , drawing her to him , embraced her affectionately . 
Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room . 
A few minutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary 's room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice . 
Princess Mary hastily wiped away her tears , went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne , and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the Frenchwoman , her voice breaking : `` It 's horrible , vile , inhuman , to take advantage of the weakness ... '' She did not finish . 
`` Leave my room , '' she exclaimed , and burst into sobs .
