Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch , its walls hung round with Persian carpets . 
The part of the room behind the columns , with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons , was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening service . 
Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair , and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows , evidently freshly changed , Pierre saw -- covered to the waist by a bright green quilt -- the familiar , majestic figure of his father , Count Bezukhov , with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion , and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome , ruddy face . 
He lay just under the icons ; his large thick hands outside the quilt . 
Into the right hand , which was lying palm downwards , a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb , and an old servant , bending over from behind the chair , held it in position .
