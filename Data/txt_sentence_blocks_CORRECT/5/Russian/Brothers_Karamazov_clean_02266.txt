Yesterday 's bottle had already been finished , and the new one was more than half empty . 
Mitya jumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again , hopelessly and incurably . 
He stared at him for a moment with wide opened eyes . 
The peasant was silently and slyly watching him , with insulting composure , and even a sort of contemptuous condescension , so Mitya fancied . 
He rushed up to him .
