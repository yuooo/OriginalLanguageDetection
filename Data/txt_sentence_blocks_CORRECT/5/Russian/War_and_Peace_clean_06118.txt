He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants . 
He knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions . 
He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man , or to make things easy for or reward anyone , merely because he felt inclined to do so . 
He could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do , but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind . 
Often , speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity , he would say : `` What can one do with our Russian peasants ? ''
