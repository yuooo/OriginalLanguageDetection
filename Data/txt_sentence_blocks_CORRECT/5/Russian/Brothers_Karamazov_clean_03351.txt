I did n't move . 
I do n't mind owning I am plucky sometimes , Karamazov . 
I simply looked at him contemptuously , as though to say , ` This is how you repay all my kindness ! 
Do it again if you like , I 'm at your service . ' 
But he did n't stab me again ; he broke down ; he was frightened at what he had done ; he threw away the knife , burst out crying , and ran away .
