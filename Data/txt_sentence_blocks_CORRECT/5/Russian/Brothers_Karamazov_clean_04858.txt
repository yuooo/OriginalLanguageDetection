the boys cried in their ringing voices , with softened faces . 
`` Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little boots , his coffin and his unhappy , sinful father , and how boldly he stood up for him alone against the whole school . '' 
`` We will remember , we will remember , '' cried the boys . 
`` He was brave , he was good ! '' 
`` Ah , how I loved him ! ''
