The angry eldest princess , with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll 's , had come into Pierre 's room after the funeral . 
With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything , except only for permission , after the blow she had received , to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much . 
She could not refrain from weeping at these words . 
Touched that this statuesque princess could so change , Pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness , without knowing what for . 
From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him .
