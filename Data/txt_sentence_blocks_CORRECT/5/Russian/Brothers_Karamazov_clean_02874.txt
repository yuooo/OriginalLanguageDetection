You see , gentlemen '' - Mitya frowned - `` it seemed to me that about feelings you 've no right to question me . 
I know that you are bound by your office , I quite understand that , but that 's my affair , my private , intimate affair , yet ... since I have n't concealed my feelings in the past ... in the tavern , for instance , I 've talked to everyone , so ... so I wo n't make a secret of it now . 
You see , I understand , gentlemen , that there are terrible facts against me in this business . 
I told everyone that I 'd kill him , and now , all of a sudden , he 's been killed . 
So it must have been me !
