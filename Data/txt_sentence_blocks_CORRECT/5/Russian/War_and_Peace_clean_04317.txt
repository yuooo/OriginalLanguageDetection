All this , like the other parts of the disposition , was not and could not be executed . 
After passing through Borodino the vice-King was driven back to the Kolocha and could get no farther ; while the divisions of Morand and Gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back , and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry -LRB- a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon -RRB- . 
So not one of the orders in the disposition was , or could be , executed . 
But in the disposition it is said that , after the fight has commenced in this manner , orders will be given in accordance with the enemy 's movements , and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle . 
But this was not and could not be done , for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that , as appeared later , he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed .
