Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province , but from several other Russian towns , as well as from Moscow and Petersburg . 
Among them were lawyers , ladies , and even several distinguished personages . 
Every ticket of admission had been snatched up . 
A special place behind the table at which the three judges sat was set apart for the most distinguished and important of the men visitors ; a row of arm-chairs had been placed there - something exceptional , which had never been allowed before . 
A large proportion not less than half of the public - were ladies .
