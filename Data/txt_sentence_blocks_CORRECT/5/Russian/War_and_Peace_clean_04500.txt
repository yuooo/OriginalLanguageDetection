asks the mind of man . 
The historians , replying to this question , lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris , calling these sayings and doings `` the Revolution '' ; then they give a detailed biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him ; tell of the influence some of these people had on others , and say : that is why this movement took place and those are its laws . 
But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation , but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious , because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger . 
The sum of human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon , and only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them . 
`` But every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors ; every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men , '' says history .
