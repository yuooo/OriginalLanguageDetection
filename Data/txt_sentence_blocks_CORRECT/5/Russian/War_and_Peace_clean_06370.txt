We only know that to produce the one or the other action , people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part , and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise , or in other words that it is a law . 
If history dealt only with external phenomena , the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument . 
But the law of history relates to man . 
A particle of matter can not tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue , but man , who is the subject of history , says plainly : I am free and am therefore not subject to the law . 
The presence of the problem of man 's free will , though unexpressed , is felt at every step of history .
