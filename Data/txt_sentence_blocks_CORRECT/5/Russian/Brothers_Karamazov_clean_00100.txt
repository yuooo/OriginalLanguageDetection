Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to suggest , apparently in joke , that they should all meet in Father Zossima 's cell , and that , without appealing to his direct intervention , they might more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence of the elder 's presence . 
Dmitri , who had never seen the elder , naturally supposed that his father was trying to intimidate him , but , as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father on several recent occasions , he accepted the challenge . 
It must be noted that he was not , like Ivan , staying with his father , but living apart at the other end of the town . 
It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov , who was staying in the district at the time , caught eagerly at the idea . 
A Liberal of the forties and fifties , a freethinker and atheist , he may have been led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion .
