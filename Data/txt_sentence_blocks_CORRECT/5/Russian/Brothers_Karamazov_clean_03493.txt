Bravo the German ! 
But he did not see the good side , what do you think ? 
Conceit may be , that comes from youth , that will be corrected if need be , but , on the other hand , there is an independent spirit almost from childhood , boldness of thought and conviction , and not the spirit of these sausage makers , grovelling before authority ... . 
But the German was right all the same . 
Bravo the German !
