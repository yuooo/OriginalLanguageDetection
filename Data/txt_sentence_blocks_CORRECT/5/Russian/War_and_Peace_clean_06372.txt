In this contradiction lies the problem of free will , which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance . 
The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view -- theological , historical , ethical , or philosophic -- we find a general law of necessity to which he -LRB- like all that exists -RRB- is subject . 
But regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of , we feel ourselves to be free . 
This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and independent of reason . 
Through his reason man observes himself , but only through consciousness does he know himself .
