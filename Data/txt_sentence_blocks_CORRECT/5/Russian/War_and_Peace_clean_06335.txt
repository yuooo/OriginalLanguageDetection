The science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire -- namely , as something existing absolutely . 
But for history , the state and power are merely phenomena , just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon . 
From this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence , it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power -- existing immutably outside time -- is , but to history 's questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing . 
If power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler , was Pugachev a representative of the will of the people ? 
If not , then why was Napoleon I ?
