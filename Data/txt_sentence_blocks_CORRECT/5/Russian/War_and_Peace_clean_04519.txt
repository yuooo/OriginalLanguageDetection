Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Platov to retreat , or was it the evening before , when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders ? 
Or was it earlier still ? 
... When , when was this terrible affair decided ? 
Moscow must be abandoned . 
The army must retreat and the order to do so must be given . ''
