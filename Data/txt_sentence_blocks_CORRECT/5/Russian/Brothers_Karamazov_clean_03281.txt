`` Have you noticed , Smurov , that in the middle of winter we do n't feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do now , in the beginning of winter , when there is a sudden frost of twelve degrees , especially when there is not much snow . 
It 's because people are not used to it . 
Everything is habit with men , everything even in their social and political relations . 
Habit is the great motive-power . 
What a funny-looking peasant ! ''
