He could just as well have said then that he was not a thief , because he brought back fourteen hundred roubles . 
Then another time he would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred , and then a third , and then a fourth , and before the end of the month he would have taken the last note but one , feeling that if he took back only a hundred it would answer the purpose , for a thief would have stolen it all . 
And then he would have looked at this last note , and have said to himself , ` It 's really not worth while to give back one hundred ; let 's spend that , too ! '
