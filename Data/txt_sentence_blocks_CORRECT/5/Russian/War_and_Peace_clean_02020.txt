From there they passed into another room . 
A man in strange attire appeared at the door . 
Willarski , stepping toward him , said something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before . 
Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard , Willarski bound Pierre 's eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind , catching some hairs painfully in the knot . 
Then he drew his face down , kissed him , and taking him by the hand led him forward .
