Though she had loved him passionately those fourteen years , he had caused her far more suffering than happiness . 
She had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day , afraid he would fall ill , would catch cold , do something naughty , climb on a chair and fall off it , and so on and so on . 
When Kolya began going to school , the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him so as to help him , and go through his lessons with him . 
She hastened to make the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives , even made up to Kolya 's schoolfellows , and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving Kolya from being teased , laughed at , or beaten by them . 
She went so far that the boys actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him with being a `` mother 's darling . ''
