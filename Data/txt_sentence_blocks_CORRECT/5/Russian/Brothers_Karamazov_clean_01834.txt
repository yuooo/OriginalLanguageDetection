My landlady 's servant waited upon me , for I had moved into her rooms simply because on my return from the duel I had sent Afanasy back to the regiment , as I felt ashamed to look him in the face after my last interview with him . 
So prone is the man of the world to be ashamed of any righteous action . 
`` I have , '' said my visitor , `` with great interest listened to you speaking in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last to make your personal acquaintance , so as to talk to you more intimately . 
Can you , dear sir , grant me this favour ? '' 
`` I can , with the greatest pleasure , and I shall look upon it as an honour . ''
