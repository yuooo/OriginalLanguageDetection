The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel 's plan , and there was no intention of retiring farther . 
The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired . 
He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smolensk , still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow , and when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smolensk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls . 
So thought the Emperor , and the Russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country . 
Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement .
