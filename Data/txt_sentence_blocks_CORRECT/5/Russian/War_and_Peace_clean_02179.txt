`` Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life , all the rest is a dream , '' said Pierre . 
`` Understand , my dear fellow , that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life , like you , merely trying not to harm others . 
But make our fundamental convictions your own , join our brotherhood , give yourself up to us , let yourself be guided , and you will at once feel yourself , as I have felt myself , a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven , '' said Pierre . 
Prince Andrew , looking straight in front of him , listened in silence to Pierre 's words . 
More than once , when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what Pierre said , he asked him to repeat it , and by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew 's eyes and by his silence , Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said .
