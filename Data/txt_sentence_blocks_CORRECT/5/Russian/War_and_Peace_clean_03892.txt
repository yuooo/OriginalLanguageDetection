He will get nothing for his pains ! 
How could they make a man commander in chief who can not mount a horse , who drops asleep at a council , and has the very worst morals ! 
A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest ! 
I do n't speak of his capacity as a general , but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit , blind old man , positively blind ? 
A fine idea to have a blind general !
