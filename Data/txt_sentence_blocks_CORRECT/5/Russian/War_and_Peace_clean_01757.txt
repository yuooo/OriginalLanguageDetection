`` Well , you see , I 'll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words . 
If you are going to fight a duel , and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents , and if you think you may be killed , you are a fool and are lost for certain . 
But go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible , and then all will be right , as our bear huntsman at Kostroma used to tell me . 
` Everyone fears a bear , ' he says , ` but when you see one your fear 's all gone , and your only thought is not to let him get away ! ' 
And that 's how it is with me .
