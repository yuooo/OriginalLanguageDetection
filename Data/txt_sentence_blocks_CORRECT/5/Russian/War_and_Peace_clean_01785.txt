`` Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her naked shoulders . 
She did not give him the money , but let herself be kissed . 
Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy , and she replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous : ` Let him do what he pleases , ' she used to say of me . 
One day I asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy . 
She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children , and that she was not going to have any children by me . ''
