That same evening -- without even asking himself what they were wanted for -- he procured a coachman 's coat and cap for Pierre , and promised to get him the pistol next day . 
Makar Alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre . 
But as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away . 
It was when Pierre -LRB- wearing the coachman 's coat which Gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam -RRB- was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the Sukharev market that he met the Rostovs . 
Kutuzov 's order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryazan road was issued at night on the first of September .
