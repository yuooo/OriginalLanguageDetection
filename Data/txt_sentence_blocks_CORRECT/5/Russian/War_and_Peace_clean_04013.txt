After sunset the wind had dropped . 
The night was calm and fresh . 
Toward midnight the voices began to subside , a cock crowed , the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees , a fresh white dewy mist began to rise , and stillness reigned over the village and the house . 
Pictures of the near past -- her father 's illness and last moments - rose one after another to her memory . 
With mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images , repelling with horror only the last one , the picture of his death , which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night .
