Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the house , and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness . 
In the intervals he used to drive all over the province , complaining tearfully to each and all of Adelaida Ivanovna 's having left him , going into details too disgraceful for a husband to mention in regard to his own married life . 
What seemed to gratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part of the injured husband , and to parade his woes with embellishments . 
`` One would think that you 'd got a promotion , Fyodor Pavlovitch , you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow , '' scoffers said to him . 
Many even added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon , and that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position .
