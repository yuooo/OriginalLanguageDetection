Bennigsen , the Tsarevich , and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy , and Barclay , feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these `` eyes of the Emperor , '' became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle . 
Barclay stood for caution . 
The Tsarevich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement . 
Lubomirski , Bronnitski , Wlocki , and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay , under pretext of sending papers to the Emperor , dispatched these Polish adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with Bennigsen and the Tsarevich . 
At Smolensk the armies at last reunited , much as Bagration disliked it .
