On Holy Thursday we drink wine and have something cooked without oil or not cooked at all , inasmuch as the Laodicean council lays down for Holy Thursday : `` It is unseemly by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to dishonour the whole of Lent ! '' 
This is how we keep the fast . 
But what is that compared with you , holy Father , '' added the monk , growing more confident , `` for all the year round , even at Easter , you take nothing but bread and water , and what we should eat in two days lasts you full seven . 
It 's truly marvellous - your great abstinence . '' 
`` And mushrooms ? ''
