The first troops started at once , and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hurry . 
At daybreak , however , those nearing the town at the Dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge , ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys , while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind , and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them . 
They all rushed forward to the bridge , onto it , and to the fords and the boats . 
Kutuzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of Moscow . 
By ten o'clock in the morning of the second of September , only the rear guard remained in the Dorogomilov suburb , where they had ample room .
