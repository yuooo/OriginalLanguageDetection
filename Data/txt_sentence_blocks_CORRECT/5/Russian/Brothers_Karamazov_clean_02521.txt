I am a wretch , but I love Thee . 
If Thou sendest me to hell , I shall love Thee there , and from there I shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever ... . 
But let me love to the end ... . 
Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of Thy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I can not help loving her . 
Thou seest my whole heart ... I shall gallop up , I shall fall before her and say , ` You are right to pass on and leave me .
