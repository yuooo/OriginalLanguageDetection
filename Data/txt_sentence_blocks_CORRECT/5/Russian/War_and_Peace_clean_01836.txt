As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage with lanterns , standing at the entrance . 
She went out on the stairs . 
On a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft . 
On the landing below , Philip , the footman , stood looking scared and holding another candle . 
Still lower , beyond the turn of the staircase , one could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots , and a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something .
