This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished . 
After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmutz where Bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad , but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes , and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth . 
At the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic ; here he seemed brighter and more energetic . 
He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles , and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite , young and animated as his own . 
Czartoryski , Novosiltsev , Prince Volkonsky , Strogonov , and the others , all richly dressed gay young men on splendid , well-groomed , fresh , only slightly heated horses , exchanging remarks and smiling , had stopped behind the Emperor .
