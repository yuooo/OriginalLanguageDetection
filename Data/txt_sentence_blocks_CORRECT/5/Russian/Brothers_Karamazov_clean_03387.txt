The sick boy turned visibly paler . 
He raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya . 
Kolya had not seen his little friend for two months , and he was overwhelmed at the sight of him . 
He had never imagined that he would see such a wasted , yellow face , such enormous , feverishly glowing eyes and such thin little hands . 
He saw , with grieved surprise , Ilusha 's rapid , hard breathing and dry lips .
