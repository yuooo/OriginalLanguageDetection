So I went down into the cellar thinking , ` Here , it 'll come on directly , it 'll strike me down directly , shall I fall ? ' 
And it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying . 
All that and all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before , when I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar , I told all that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch , the investigating lawyer , and it 's all been written down in the protocol . 
And the doctor here , Mr. Varvinsky , maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it brought it on , the apprehension that I might fall . 
It was just then that the fit seized me .
