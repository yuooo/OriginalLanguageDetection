In the evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch ; he was informed that Grigory , who had not been well for the last three days , was completely laid up by his lumbago . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his tea as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house . 
He was in terrible excitement and suspense . 
That evening he reckoned on Grushenka 's coming almost as a certainty . 
He had received from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance `` that she had promised to come without fail . ''
