On each side of the trench , the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet , and this did duty for bedsteads and couches . 
The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table . 
Denisov , who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him , had also a board in the roof at the farther end , with a piece of -LRB- broken but mended -RRB- glass in it for a window . 
When it was very cold , embers from the soldiers ' campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the `` reception room '' -- as Denisov called that part of the hut - and it was then so warm that the officers , of whom there were always some with Denisov and Rostov , sat in their shirt sleeves . 
In April , Rostov was on orderly duty .
