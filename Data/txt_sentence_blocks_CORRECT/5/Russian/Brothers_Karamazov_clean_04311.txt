And as for our lousy peasants , it was n't a case of flinging half a rouble in the street , he made them presents of twenty-five roubles each , at least , he did n't give them less . 
And what a lot of money was simply stolen from him ! 
And if anyone did steal , he did not leave a receipt . 
How could one catch the thief when he was flinging his money away all the time ? 
Our peasants are robbers , you know ; they have no care for their souls .
