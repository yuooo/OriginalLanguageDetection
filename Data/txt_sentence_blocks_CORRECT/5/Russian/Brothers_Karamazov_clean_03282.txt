Kolya pointed to a tall peasant , with a good-natured countenance in a long sheepskin coat , who was standing by his wagon , clapping together his hands , in their shapeless leather gloves , to warm them . 
His long fair beard was all white with frost . 
`` That peasant 's beard 's frozen , '' Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice as he passed him . 
`` Lots of people 's beards are frozen , '' the peasant replied , calmly and sententiously . 
`` Do n't provoke him , '' observed Smurov .
