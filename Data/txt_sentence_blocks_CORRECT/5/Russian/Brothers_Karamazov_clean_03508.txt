Oh , how I have longed to know you , Karamazov ! 
I 've long been eager for this meeting . 
Can you really have thought about me , too ? 
You said just now that you thought of me , too ? '' 
`` Yes , I 'd heard of you and had thought of you , too ... and if it 's partly vanity that makes you ask , it does n't matter . ''
