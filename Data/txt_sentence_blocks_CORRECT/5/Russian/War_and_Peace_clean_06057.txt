If the aim was the aggrandizement of France , that might have been attained without the Revolution and without the Empire . 
If the aim was the dissemination of ideas , the printing press could have accomplished that much better than warfare . 
If the aim was the progress of civilization , it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives . 
Why did it happen in this and not in some other way ? 
Because it happened so !
