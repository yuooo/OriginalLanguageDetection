But his chief trouble , I must explain however obscurely , lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of , to have the right to take it , he must first restore Katerina Ivanovna 's three thousand - if not , `` I 'm a common pick-pocket , I 'm a scoundrel , and I do n't want to begin a new life as a scoundrel , '' Mitya decided . 
And so he made up his mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three thousand , and that first of all . 
The final stage of this decision , so to say , had been reached only during the last hours , that is , after his last interview with Alyosha , two days before , on the high-road , on the evening when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna , and Mitya , after hearing Alyosha 's account of it , had admitted that he was a scoundrel , and told him to tell Katerina Ivanovna so , if it could be any comfort to her . 
After parting from his brother on that night , he had felt in his frenzy that it would be better `` to murder and rob someone than fail to pay my debt to Katya . 
I 'd rather everyone thought me a robber and a murderer ; I 'd rather go to Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceived her and stole her money , and used her money to run away with Grushenka and begin a new life !
