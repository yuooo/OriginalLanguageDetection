`` Fire , Medvedev ! '' 
Bagration called to him , and Tushin , raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest 's benediction , approached the general . 
Though Tushin 's guns had been intended to cannonade the valley , he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Schon Grabern visible just opposite , in front of which large masses of French were advancing . 
No one had given Tushin orders where and at what to fire , but after consulting his sergeant major , Zakharchenko , for whom he had great respect , he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village .
