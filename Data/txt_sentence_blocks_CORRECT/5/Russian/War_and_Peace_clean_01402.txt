The one who was writing and whom Boris addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkonski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him . 
Boris thanked him and went to the reception room , where he found some ten officers and generals . 
When he entered , Prince Andrew , his eyes drooping contemptuously -LRB- with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says , `` If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment '' -RRB- , was listening to an old Russian general with decorations , who stood very erect , almost on tiptoe , with a soldier 's obsequious expression on his purple face , reporting something . 
`` Very well , then , be so good as to wait , '' said Prince Andrew to the general , in Russian , speaking with the French intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously , and noticing Boris , Prince Andrew , paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more , nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile . 
At that moment Boris clearly realized what he had before surmised , that in the army , besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code , which he and the others knew in the regiment , there was another , more important , subordination , which made this tight-laced , purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew , for his own pleasure , chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskoy .
