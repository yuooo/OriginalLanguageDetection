All her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they all -- she herself , Mamma , and Sonya -- should be as well dressed as possible . 
Sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands . 
The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress , and the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips , with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed a la grecque . 
Everything essential had already been done ; feet , hands , necks , and ears washed , perfumed , and powdered , as befits a ball ; the openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on ; the hairdressing was almost done . 
Sonya was finishing dressing and so was the countess , but Natasha , who had bustled about helping them all , was behindhand .
