So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of Denisov 's . 
That was why Petya had blushed and grown confused when Denisov asked him whether he could stay . 
Before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest Petya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once . 
But when he saw the French and saw Tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night , he decided , with the rapidity with which young people change their views , that the general , whom he had greatly respected till then , was a rubbishy German , that Denisov was a hero , the esaul a hero , and Tikhon a hero too , and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty . 
It was already growing dusk when Denisov , Petya , and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse .
