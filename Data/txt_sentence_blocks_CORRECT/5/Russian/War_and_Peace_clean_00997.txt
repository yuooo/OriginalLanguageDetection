But the guns remained loaded , the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly , and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before . 
Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left , Prince Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen . 
Here he dismounted , and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon . 
Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down ; he stood at attention when the officer arrived , but at a sign resumed his measured , monotonous pacing . 
Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen 's bonfires .
