The officer mounted his horse and rode after him . 
When he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns , the infantry crossing the bridge , several overturned carts , and frightened and laughing faces among the troops . 
Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed . 
Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels . 
The cart was loaded high , and at the very top , beside a child 's chair with its legs in the air , sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks .
