Platov 's division was acting independently of the main army . 
Several times parts of the Pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy , had taken prisoners , and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot 's carriages . 
In April the Pavlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village . 
A thaw had set in , it was muddy and cold , the ice on the river broke , and the roads became impassable . 
For days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued .
