But she was not even grateful to him for it ; nothing good on Pierre 's part seemed to her to be an effort , it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness . 
Sometimes Natasha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence , especially when he wanted to do something to please her , or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her . 
She noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness , which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her . 
After those involuntary words -- that if he were free he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love -- uttered at a moment when she was so strongly agitated , Pierre never spoke to Natasha of his feelings ; and it seemed plain to her that those words , which had then so comforted her , were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child . 
It was not because Pierre was a married man , but because Natasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with Kuragin that it never entered her head that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her part , still less on his , or even to the kind of tender , self-conscious , romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several instances .
