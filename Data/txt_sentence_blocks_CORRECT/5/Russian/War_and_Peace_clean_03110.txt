Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her , Princess Mary was agitated just then because on the Rostovs ' being announced , the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them , that Princess Mary might do so if she chose , but they were not to be admitted to him . 
She had decided to receive them , but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some freak , as he seemed much upset by the Rostovs ' visit . 
`` There , my dear princess , I 've brought you my songstress , '' said the count , bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince might appear . 
`` I am so glad you should get to know one another ... very sorry the prince is still ailing , '' and after a few more commonplace remarks he rose . 
`` If you 'll allow me to leave my Natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour , Princess , I 'll drive round to see Anna Semenovna , it 's quite near in the Dogs ' Square , and then I 'll come back for her . ''
