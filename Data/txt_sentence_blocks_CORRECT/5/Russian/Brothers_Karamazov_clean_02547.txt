Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya , but at once obediently did his bidding . 
Leading him into the passage , he went himself into the first large room , adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting , and took the light away . 
Then he stealthily led Mitya in , and put him in a corner in the dark , whence he could freely watch the company without being seen . 
But Mitya did not look long , and , indeed , he could not see them ; he saw her , his heart throbbed violently , and all was dark before his eyes . 
She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair , and beside her , on the sofa , was the pretty youth , Kalganov .
