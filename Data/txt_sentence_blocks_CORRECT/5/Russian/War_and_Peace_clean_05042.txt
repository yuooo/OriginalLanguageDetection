`` Oh , how oppressive this continual delirium is , '' thought Prince Andrew , trying to drive that face from his imagination . 
But the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer . 
Prince Andrew wished to return that former world of pure thought , but he could not , and delirium drew him back into its domain . 
The soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur , something oppressed him and stretched out , and the strange face was before him . 
Prince Andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his senses , he moved a little , and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears , a dimness in his eyes , and like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness .
