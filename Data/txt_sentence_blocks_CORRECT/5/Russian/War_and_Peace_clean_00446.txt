Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on , having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential . 
The chanting of the service ceased , and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament . 
The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before . 
Around him everyone began to stir : steps were audible and whispers , among which Anna Mikhaylovna 's was the most distinct . 
Pierre heard her say : `` Certainly he must be moved onto the bed ; here it will be impossible ... '' The sick man was so surrounded by doctors , princesses , and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane -- which , though he saw other faces as well , he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service .
