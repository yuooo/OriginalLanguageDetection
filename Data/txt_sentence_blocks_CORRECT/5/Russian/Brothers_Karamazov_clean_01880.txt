I took up the New Testament from the table , the Russian translation , and showed him the Gospel of St. John , chapter 12 , verse 24 : `` Verily , verily , I say unto you , except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . '' 
I had just been reading that verse when he came in . 
He read it . 
`` That 's true , '' he said , he smiled bitterly . 
`` It 's terrible the things you find in those books , '' he said , after a pause .
