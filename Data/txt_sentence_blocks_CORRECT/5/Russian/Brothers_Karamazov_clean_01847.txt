I began to regard my mysterious visitor with admiration , for besides enjoying his intelligence , I began to perceive that he was brooding over some plan in his heart , and was preparing himself perhaps for a great deed . 
Perhaps he liked my not showing curiosity about his secret , not seeking to discover it by direct question nor by insinuation . 
But I noticed at last , that he seemed to show signs of wanting to tell me something . 
This had become quite evident , indeed , about a month after he first began to visit me . 
`` Do you know , '' he said to me once , `` that people are very inquisitive about us in the town and wonder why I come to see you so often .
