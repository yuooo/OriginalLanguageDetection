`` Ivan does n't talk to me of Mitya 's case , '' he said slowly . 
`` He 's said very little to me these last two months . 
And whenever I go to see him , he seems vexed at my coming , so I 've not been to him for the last three weeks . 
H 'm ! 
... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week . ''
