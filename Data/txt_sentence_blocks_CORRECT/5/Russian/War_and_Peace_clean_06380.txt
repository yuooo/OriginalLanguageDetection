How should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded -- as the result of the free , or as the result of the constrained , activity of man ? 
That is a question for history . 
Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledge - thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance , the diffusion of printed matter -- has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself can not exist . 
In our time the majority of so-called advanced people -- that is , the crowd of ignoramuses -- have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem . 
They say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist , for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves ; the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes .
