I am surprised to remember that my wrath and revengeful feelings were extremely repugnant to my own nature , for being of an easy temper , I found it difficult to be angry with anyone for long , and so I had to work myself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd . 
I waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my `` rival '' in the presence of a large company . 
I insulted him on a perfectly extraneous pretext , jeering at his opinion upon an important public event - it was in the year 1826 - my jeer was , so people said , clever and effective . 
Then I forced him to ask for an explanation , and behaved so rudely that he accepted my challenge in spite of the vast inequality between us , as I was younger , a person of no consequence , and of inferior rank . 
I learned afterwards for a fact that it was from a jealous feeling on his side also that my challenge was accepted ; he had been rather jealous of me on his wife 's account before their marriage ; he fancied now that if he submitted to be insulted by me and refused to accept my challenge , and if she heard of it , she might begin to despise him and waver in her love for him .
