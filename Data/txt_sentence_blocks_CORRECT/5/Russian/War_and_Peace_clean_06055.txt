The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon can not be called useful or harmful , for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful . 
If that activity displeases somebody , this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good . 
Whether the preservation of my father 's house in Moscow , or the glory of the Russian arms , or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities , or the freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia , or the balance of power in Europe , or a certain kind of European culture called `` progress '' appear to me to be good or bad , I must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me . 
But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events ; let us say that Alexander could have done everything differently ; let us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity , he might have arranged matters according to the program his present accusers would have given him -- of nationality , freedom , equality , and progress -LRB- these , I think , cover the ground -RRB- . 
Let us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated , and that Alexander had acted on it .
