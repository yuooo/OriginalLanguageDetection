Elders SOME of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly , ecstatic , poorly developed creature , a pale , consumptive dreamer . 
On the contrary , Alyosha was at this time a well-grown , red-cheeked , clear-eyed lad of nineteen , radiant with health . 
He was very handsome , too , graceful , moderately tall , with hair of a dark brown , with a regular , rather long , oval-shaped face , and wide-set dark grey , shining eyes ; he was very thoughtful , and apparently very serene . 
I shall be told , perhaps , that red cheeks are not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism ; but I fancy that Alyosha was more of a realist than anyone . 
Oh !
