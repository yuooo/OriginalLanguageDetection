Forty eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here , and his Serene Highness says he will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets . 
Do not be upset , brothers , that the law courts are closed ; things have to be put in order , and we will deal with villains in our own way ! 
When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two beforehand , but they are not wanted yet so I hold my peace . 
An ax will be useful , a hunting spear not bad , but a three-pronged fork will be best of all : a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye . 
Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water blessed .
