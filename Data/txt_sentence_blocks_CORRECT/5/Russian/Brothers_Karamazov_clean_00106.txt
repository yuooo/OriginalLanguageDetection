Our visitors did not take part in the service , but arrived just as it was over . 
First an elegant open carriage , drawn by two valuable horses , drove up with Miusov and a distant relative of his , a young man of twenty , called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov . 
This young man was preparing to enter the university . 
Miusov with whom he was staying for the time , was trying to persuade him to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena . 
The young man was still undecided .
