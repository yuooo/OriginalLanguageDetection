`` Do n't mess Mary Hendrikhovna 's dress ! '' 
cried other voices . 
Rostov and Ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending Mary Hendrikhovna 's modesty . 
They were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change , but found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box , and these officers would on no account yield their position . 
Mary Hendrikhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain , and behind that screen Rostov and Ilyin , helped by Lavrushka who had brought their kits , changed their wet things for dry ones .
