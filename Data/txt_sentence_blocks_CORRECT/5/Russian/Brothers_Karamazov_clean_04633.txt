As soon as it was made plain to him that she loved him and called him to her side , promising him new happiness , oh ! 
then , I protest he must have felt the impulse to suicide doubled , trebled , and must have killed himself , if he had his father 's murder on his conscience . 
Oh , no ! 
he would not have forgotten where his pistols lay ! 
I know the prisoner : the savage , stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor is inconsistent with his character .
