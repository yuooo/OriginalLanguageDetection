I know that at the end of all things I shall be reconciled . 
I , too , shall walk my quadrillion and learn the secret . 
But till that happens I am sulking and fulfil my destiny though it 's against the grain - that is , to ruin thousands for the sake of saving one . 
How many souls have had to be ruined and how many honourable reputations destroyed for the sake of that one righteous man , Job , over whom they made such a fool of me in old days ! 
Yes , till the secret is revealed , there are two sorts of truths for me - one , their truth , yonder , which I know nothing about so far , and the other my own .
