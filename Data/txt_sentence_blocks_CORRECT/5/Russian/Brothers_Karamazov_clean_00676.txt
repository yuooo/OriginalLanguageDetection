Foma comes from our parts ; he was a soldier in our regiment . 
He does jobs for them . 
He 's watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting in the day-time ; and that 's how he lives . 
I 've established myself in his room . 
Neither he nor the women of the house know the secret - that is , that I am on the watch here . ''
