Had Speranski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the same breeding and traditions , Bolkonski would soon have discovered his weak , human , unheroic sides ; but as it was , Speranski 's strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite understand him . 
Moreover , Speranski , either because he appreciated the other 's capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to his side , showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that one 's companion is the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of one 's own ideas . 
During their long conversation on Wednesday evening , Speranski more than once remarked : `` We regard everything that is above the common level of rooted custom ... '' or , with a smile : `` But we want the wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe ... '' or : `` They can not understand this ... '' and all in a way that seemed to say : `` We , you and I , understand what they are and who we are . '' 
This first long conversation with Speranski only strengthened in Prince Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting . 
He saw in him a remarkable , clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power , which he was using solely for the welfare of Russia .
