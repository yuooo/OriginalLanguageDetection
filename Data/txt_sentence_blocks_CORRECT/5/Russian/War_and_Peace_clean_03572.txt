Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel , angry , determined , and absurdly self-confident as he was . 
Of all those present , evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself , nursed no hatred against anyone , and only desired that the plan , formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil , should be carried out . 
He was ridiculous , and unpleasantly sarcastic , but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea . 
Besides this , the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805 : there was now a panic fear of Napoleon 's genius , which , though concealed , was noticeable in every rejoinder .
