`` But that 's impossible , '' said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago . 
Pierre looked at him in surprise . 
`` And yet they say that war is like a game of chess ? '' 
he remarked . 
`` Yes , '' replied Prince Andrew , `` but with this little difference , that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time , and with this difference too , that a knight is always stronger than a pawn , and two pawns are always stronger than one , while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company .
