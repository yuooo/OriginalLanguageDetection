When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which Karataev generally lay down at the halting places , and when he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before , Pierre moved farther away and did not think about him . 
While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect but with his whole being , by life itself , that man is created for happiness , that happiness is within him , in the satisfaction of simple human needs , and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity . 
And now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new , consolatory truth -- that nothing in this world is terrible . 
He had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free , so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom . 
He learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are very near together ; that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now , sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming ; and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores -- his footgear having long since fallen to pieces .
