The house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass . 
It was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees . 
The homestead consisted of a threshing floor , outhouses , stables , a bathhouse , a lodge , and a large brick house with semicircular facade still in course of construction . 
Round the house was a garden newly laid out . 
The fences and gates were new and solid ; two fire pumps and a water cart , painted green , stood in a shed ; the paths were straight , the bridges were strong and had handrails .
