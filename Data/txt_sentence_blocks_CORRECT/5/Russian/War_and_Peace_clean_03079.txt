`` It is a ray of light in the darkness , a shade between sadness and despair , showing the possibility of consolation . '' 
In reply Boris wrote these lines : Aliment de poison d'une ame trop sensible , Toi , sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible , Tendre melancholie , ah , viens me consoler , Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite , Et mele une douceur secrete A ces pleurs que je sens couler . 
* * Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul , Thou , without whom happiness would for me be impossible , Tender melancholy , ah , come to console me , Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat , And mingle a secret sweetness With these tears that I feel to be flowing . 
For Boris , Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp . 
Boris read Poor Liza aloud to her , and more than once interrupted the reading because of the emotions that choked him .
