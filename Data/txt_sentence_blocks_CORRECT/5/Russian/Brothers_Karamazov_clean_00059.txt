I have mentioned already that he looked bloated . 
His countenance at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life he had led . 
Besides the long fleshy bags under his little , always insolent , suspicious , and ironical eyes ; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles in his little fat face , the Adam 's apple hung below his sharp chin like a great , fleshy goitre , which gave him a peculiar , repulsive , sensual appearance ; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips , between which could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth . 
He slobbered every time he began to speak . 
He was fond indeed of making fun of his own face , though , I believe , he was well satisfied with it .
