Nicholas and his attendant , with `` Uncle '' and his huntsman , were all riding round the wolf , crying `` ulyulyu ! '' 
shouting and preparing to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back , and starting forward again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she would be safe . 
Already , at the beginning of this chase , Daniel , hearing the ulyulyuing , had rushed out from the wood . 
He saw Karay seize the wolf , and checked his horse , supposing the affair to be over . 
But when he saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for safety , Daniel set his chestnut galloping , not at the wolf but straight toward the wood , just as Karay had run to cut the animal off .
