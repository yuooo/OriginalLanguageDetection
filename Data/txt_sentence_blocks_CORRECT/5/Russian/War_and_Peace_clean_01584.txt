Rostov , fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French , galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go , but still was not in time to avoid them . 
The last of the Horse Guards , a huge pockmarked fellow , frowned angrily on seeing Rostov before him , with whom he would inevitably collide . 
This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostov and his Bedouin over -LRB- Rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses -RRB- had it not occurred to Rostov to flourish his whip before the eyes of the Guardsman 's horse . 
The heavy black horse , sixteen hands high , shied , throwing back its ears ; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently , and the horse , flourishing its tail and extending its neck , galloped on yet faster . 
Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostov before he heard them shout , `` Hurrah ! ''
