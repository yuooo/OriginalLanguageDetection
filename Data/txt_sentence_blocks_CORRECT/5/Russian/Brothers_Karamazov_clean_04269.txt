He looked about forty . 
His face would have been pleasant , if it had not been for his eyes , which , in themselves small and inexpressive , were set remarkably close together , with only the thin , long nose as a dividing line between them . 
In fact , there was something strikingly birdlike about his face . 
He was in evening dress and white tie . 
I remember the President 's first questions to Mitya , about his name , his calling , and so on .
