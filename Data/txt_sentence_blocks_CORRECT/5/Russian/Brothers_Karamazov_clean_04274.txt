I remember how , immediately after it had been read , the President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice : `` Prisoner , do you plead guilty ? '' 
Mitya suddenly rose from his seat . 
`` I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation , '' he exclaimed , again in a startling , almost frenzied , voice , `` to idleness and debauchery . 
I meant to become an honest man for good , just at the moment when I was struck down by fate . 
But I am not guilty of the death of that old man , my enemy and my father .
