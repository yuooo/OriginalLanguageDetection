Now , I thought , he is all that binds me , and he is my judge . 
I ca n't refuse to face my punishment to-morrow , for he knows all . 
It was not that I was afraid you would betray me -LRB- I never even thought of that -RRB- , but I thought , ` How can I look him in the face if I do n't confess ? ' 
And if you had been at the other end of the earth , but alive , it would have been all the same , the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowing everything and condemning me . 
I hated you as though you were the cause , as though you were to blame for everything .
