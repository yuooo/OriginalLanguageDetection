Only a few of these young men , among them Boris , entered more deeply into Julie 's melancholy , and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly things , and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful sketches , maxims , and verses . 
To Boris , Julie was particularly gracious : she regretted his early disillusionment with life , offered him such consolation of friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render , and showed him her album . 
Boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote : `` Rustic trees , your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me . '' 
On another page he drew a tomb , and wrote : La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille . 
Ah !
