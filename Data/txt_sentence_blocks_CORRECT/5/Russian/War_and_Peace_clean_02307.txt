Rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on Boris ' face , and as always happens to those in a bad humor , it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in everybody 's way . 
He really was in their way , for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general .
