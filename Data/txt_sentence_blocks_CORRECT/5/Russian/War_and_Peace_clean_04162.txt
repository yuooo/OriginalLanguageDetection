At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the Lobnoe Place , Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself . 
On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstafey -- his head coachman who knew everything , could do anything , and was known to all Moscow - that he would leave that night for the army at Mozhaysk , and that his saddle horses should be sent there . 
This could not all be arranged that day , so on Evstafey 's representation Pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance . 
On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain , and after dinner Pierre left Moscow . 
When changing horses that night in Perkhushkovo , he learned that there had been a great battle that evening .
