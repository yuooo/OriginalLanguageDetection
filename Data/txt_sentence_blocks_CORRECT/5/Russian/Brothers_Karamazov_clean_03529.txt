`` Father , father , come ... we ... '' Ilusha faltered in violent excitement , but apparently unable to go on , he flung his wasted arms , found his father and Kolya , uniting them in one embrace , and hugging them as tightly as he could .

`` Father , father ! 
How sorry I am for you ! '' 
Ilusha moaned bitterly .
