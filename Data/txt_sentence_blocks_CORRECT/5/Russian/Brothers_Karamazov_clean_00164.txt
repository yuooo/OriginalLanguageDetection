When you said just now , ` Do n't be so ashamed of yourself , for that is at the root of it all , ' you pierced right through me by that remark , and read me to the core . 
Indeed , I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all , and that they all take me for a buffoon . 
So I say , ` Let me really play the buffoon . 
I am not afraid of your opinion , for you are every one of you worse than I am . ' 
That is why I am a buffoon .
