Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front , the French separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours . 
In front of them all fled the Emperor , then the kings , then the dukes . 
The Russian army , expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the Dnieper -- which was the only reasonable thing for him to do -- themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at Krasnoe . 
And here as in a game of blindman 's buff the French ran into our vanguard . 
Seeing their enemy unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright , but then they resumed their flight , abandoning their comrades who were farther behind .
