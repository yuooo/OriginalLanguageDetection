Denisov and Rostov were living in an earth hut , dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf . 
The hut was made in the following manner , which had then come into vogue . 
A trench was dug three and a half feet wide , four feet eight inches deep , and eight feet long . 
At one end of the trench , steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule . 
The trench itself was the room , in which the lucky ones , such as the squadron commander , had a board , lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance , to serve as a table .
