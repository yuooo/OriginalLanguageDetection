My father is right . 
Selfish , vain , stupid , trivial in everything -- that 's what women are when you see them in their true colors ! 
When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them , but there 's nothing , nothing , nothing ! 
No , do n't marry , my dear fellow ; do n't marry ! '' 
concluded Prince Andrew .
