He used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch , that when he began to speak of Mitya , Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not understand what child he was talking about , and even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house .

Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting , of suddenly playing an unexpected part , sometimes without any motive for doing so , and even to his own direct disadvantage , as , for instance , in the present case . 
This habit , however , is characteristic of a very great number of people , some of them very clever ones , not like Fyodor Pavlovitch .
