Beside himself with enthusiasm , Rostov ran after him with the crowd . 
The Emperor rode to the square where , facing one another , a battalion of the Preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left . 
As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions , which presented arms , another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank , and at the head of them Rostov recognized Napoleon . 
It could be no one else . 
He came at a gallop , wearing a small hat , a blue uniform open over a white vest , and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder .
