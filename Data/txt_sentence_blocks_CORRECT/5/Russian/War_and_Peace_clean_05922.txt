He could not see an aim , for he now had faith -- not faith in any kind of rule , or words , or ideas , but faith in an ever-living , ever-manifest God . 
Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself . 
That search for an aim had been simply a search for God , and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago : that God is here and everywhere . 
In his captivity he had learned that in Karataev God was greater , more infinite and unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the Freemasons . 
He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet .
