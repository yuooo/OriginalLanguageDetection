Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the commander in chief . 
At six in the evening , Kutuzov went to the Emperor 's headquarters and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court , Count Tolstoy . 
Bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from Dolgorukov .

`` Well , how d'you do , my dear fellow ? ''
