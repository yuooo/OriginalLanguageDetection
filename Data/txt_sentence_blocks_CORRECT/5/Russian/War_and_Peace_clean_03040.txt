Boris , who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before , had been anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkonski , and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house . 
The prince 's house did not belong to what is known as fashionable society , but his little circle -- though not much talked about in town -- was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other . 
Boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in his presence invited Rostopchin to dinner on St. Nicholas ' Day , and Rostopchin had replied that he could not come : `` On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince Nicholas Bolkonski . '' 
`` Oh , yes , yes ! '' 
replied the commander in chief .
