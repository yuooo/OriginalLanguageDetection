It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch , and that 's better , ever so much better ! 
Oh ! 
not better that a son should have killed his father , I do n't defend that . 
Children ought to honour their parents , and yet it would be better if it were he , as you 'd have nothing to cry over then , for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was conscious , but did not know what he was doing . 
Let them acquit him - that 's so humane , and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are .
