Reviewing his impressions of the recent battle , picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create , or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers , Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness . 
As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory . 
Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed , but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy , as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away . 
He again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle , and feeling reassured he dozed off ... . 
The dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning .
