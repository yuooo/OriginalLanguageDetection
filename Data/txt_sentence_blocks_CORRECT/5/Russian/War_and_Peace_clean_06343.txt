Is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of Louis XIV , XV , and XVI , their mistresses and ministers , and by the lives of Napoleon , Rousseau , Diderot , Beaumarchais , and others ? 
Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazan and Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Ivan the Terrible and by his correspondence with Kurbski ? 
Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies ? 
For us that movement of the peoples from west to east , without leaders , with a crowd of vagrants , and with Peter the Hermit , remains incomprehensible . 
And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade -- the deliverance of Jerusalem -- had been clearly defined by historic leaders .
