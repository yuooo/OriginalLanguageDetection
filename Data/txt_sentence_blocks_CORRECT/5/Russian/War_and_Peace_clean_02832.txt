came a third voice just then , and `` Uncle 's '' red borzoi , straining and curving its back , caught up with the two foremost borzois , pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain , put on speed close to the hare , knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield , again put on speed still more viciously , sinking to his knees in the muddy field , and all one could see was how , muddying his back , he rolled over with the hare . 
A ring of borzois surrounded him .
