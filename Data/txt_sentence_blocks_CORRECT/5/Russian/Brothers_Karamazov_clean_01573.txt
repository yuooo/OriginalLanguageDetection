` The wise and dread spirit , the spirit of self-destruction and non-existence , ' the old man goes on , great spirit talked with Thee in the wilderness , and we are told in the books that he `` tempted '' Thee . 
Is that so ? 
And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject , and what in the books is called `` the temptation '' ? 
And yet if there has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle , it took place on that day , on the day of the three temptations .
