He recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with Potemkin . 
And he saw before him a plump , rather sallow-faced , short , stout woman , the Empress Mother , with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him , and then that same face on the catafalque , and the encounter he had with Zubov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand .
