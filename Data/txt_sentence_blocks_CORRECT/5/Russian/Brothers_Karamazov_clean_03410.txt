Not to lose precious time , Kolya , in desperate haste , shouted to Perezvon , `` Dead ! '' 
And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air . 
The boys laughed , Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile , but the person most delighted with the dog 's performance was `` mamma . '' 
She laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers and calling it , `` Perezvon , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Nothing will make him get up , nothing ! ''
