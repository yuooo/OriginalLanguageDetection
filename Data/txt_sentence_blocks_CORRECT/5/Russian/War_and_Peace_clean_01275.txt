After tea , the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was asked to play on the clavichord . 
Anatole , laughing and in high spirits , came and leaned on his elbows , facing her and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion . 
Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic . 
But Anatole 's expression , though his eyes were fixed on her , referred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne 's little foot , which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord .
