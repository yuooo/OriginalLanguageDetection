Anticipation that the failure of the Petersburg Berezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov led to dissatisfaction , contempt , and ridicule , more and more strongly expressed . 
The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form , making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame . 
They did not talk seriously to him ; when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality , but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at every turn . 
Because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old man ; that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans , that he would answer with his phrases -LRB- which they thought were mere phrases -RRB- about a `` golden bridge , '' about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions , and so forth . 
They had heard all that before .
