Now a second , rather more favourable alternative : follow me carefully , or I may get confused again - my head 's going round - and so , for the second alternative : I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand , that is , only half . 
Next day I go and take that half to her : ` Katya , take this fifteen hundred from me , I 'm a low beast , and an untrustworthy scoundrel , for I 've wasted half the money , and I shall waste this , too , so keep me from temptation ! ' 
Well , what of that alternative ? 
I should be a beast and a scoundrel , and whatever you like ; but not a thief , not altogether a thief , or I should not have brought back what was left , but have kept that , too . 
She would see at once that since I brought back half , I should pay back what I 'd spent , that I should never give up trying to , that I should work to get it and pay it back .
