He reported that his regiment had been attacked by French cavalry and that , though the attack had been repulsed , he had lost more than half his men . 
He said the attack had been repulsed , employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment , but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him , and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up . 
All he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted `` Cavalry ! '' 
and our men had begun firing . 
They were still firing , not at the cavalry which had disappeared , but at French infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men .
