Nearly all the French dragoons were galloping back . 
Rostov , picking out one on a gray horse , dashed after him . 
On the way he came upon a bush , his gallant horse cleared it , and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected . 
That Frenchman , by his uniform an officer , was going at a gallop , crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber . 
In another moment Rostov 's horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officer 's horse , almost knocking it over , and at the same instant Rostov , without knowing why , raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it .
