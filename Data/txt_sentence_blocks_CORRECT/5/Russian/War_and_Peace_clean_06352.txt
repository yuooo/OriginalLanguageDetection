On the other hand , even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events , history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect , that is to say , their commands are often not executed , and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs . 
Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we can not regard `` power '' as the cause of events . 
Power , from the standpoint of experience , is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someone 's will and the execution of that will by others . 
To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will , referring it to man and not to the Deity . 
If the Deity issues a command , expresses His will , as ancient history tells us , the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything , for the Divinity is not controlled by an event .
