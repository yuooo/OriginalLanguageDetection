Even Grushenka 's two servants -LRB- after the catastrophe of which we will speak later -RRB- testified in court that she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch simply from fear because `` he threatened to murder her . '' 
These servants were an old cook , invalidish and almost deaf , who came from Grushenka 's old home , and her granddaughter , a smart young girl of twenty , who performed the duties of a maid . 
Grushenka lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but luxurious . 
Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany furniture in the fashion of 1820 , belonging to her landlady . 
It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms , yet they were not lighted up .
