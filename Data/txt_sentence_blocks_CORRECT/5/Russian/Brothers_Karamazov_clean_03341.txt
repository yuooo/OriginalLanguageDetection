I noticed that there was a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy , and you know I have a positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality , and I have had it from a baby . 
There were contradictions in him , too : he was proud , but he was slavishly devoted to me , and yet all at once his eyes would flash and he 'd refuse to agree with me ; he 'd argue , fly into a rage . 
I used sometimes to propound certain ideas ; I could see that it was not so much that he disagreed with the ideas , but that he was simply rebelling against me , because I was cool in responding to his endearments . 
And so , in order to train him properly , the tenderer he was , the colder I became . 
I did it on purpose : that was my idea .
