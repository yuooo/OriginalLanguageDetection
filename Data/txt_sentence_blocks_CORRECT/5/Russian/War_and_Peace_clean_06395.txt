Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body . 
I lift my arm and let it fall . 
My action seems to me free ; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every direction , I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body . 
I chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles . 
For my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles .
