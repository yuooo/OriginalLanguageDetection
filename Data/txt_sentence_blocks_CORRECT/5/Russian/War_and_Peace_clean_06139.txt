It was the eve of St. Nicholas , the fifth of December , 1820 . 
Natasha had been staying at her brother 's with her husband and children since early autumn . 
Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three weeks as he said , but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute . 
Besides the Bezukhov family , Nicholas ' old friend the retired General Vasili Dmitrich Denisov was staying with the Rostovs this fifth of December . 
On the sixth , which was his name day when the house would be full of visitors , Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for a tail coat , and put on narrow boots with pointed toes , and drive to the new church he had built , and then receive visitors who would come to congratulate him , offer them refreshments , and talk about the elections of the nobility ; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in his usual way .
