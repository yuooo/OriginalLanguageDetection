The French had not yet occupied that region , and the Russians -- the uninjured and slightly wounded -- had left it long ago . 
All about the field , like heaps of manure on well-kept plowland , lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres . 
The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans , sometimes feigned -- or so it seemed to Rostov . 
He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men , and he felt afraid -- afraid not for his life , but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates . 
The French , who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at , on seeing an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots .
