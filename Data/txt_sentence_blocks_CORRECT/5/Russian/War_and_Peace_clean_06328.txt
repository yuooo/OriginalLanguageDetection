But the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself , for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round ; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler , he has no right to stop in his search for the cause . 
The man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation . 
The only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed . 
The only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples . 
Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds , all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed .
