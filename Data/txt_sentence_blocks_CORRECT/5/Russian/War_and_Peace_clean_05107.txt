The Empress Marya , concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage , had given directions that they should all be removed to Kazan , and the things belonging to these institutions had already been packed up . 
The Empress Elisabeth , however , when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give -- with her characteristic Russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign , but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg . 
At Anna Pavlovna 's on the twenty-sixth of August , the very day of the battle of Borodino , there was a soiree , the chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius . 
It was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical , patriotic eloquence . 
Prince Vasili himself , famed for his elocution , was to read it .
