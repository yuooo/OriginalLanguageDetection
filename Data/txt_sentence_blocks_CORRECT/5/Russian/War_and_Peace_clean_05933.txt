Willarski was a married man with a family , busy with his family affairs , his wife 's affairs , and his official duties . 
He regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life , and considered that they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family . 
Military , administrative , political , and Masonic interests continually absorbed his attention . 
And Pierre , without trying to change the other 's views and without condemning him , but with the quiet , joyful , and amused smile now habitual to him , was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon . 
There was a new feature in Pierre 's relations with Willarski , with the princess , with the doctor , and with all the people he now met , which gained for him the general good will .
