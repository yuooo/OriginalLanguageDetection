This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power . 
This relation consists in the following : For common action people always unite in certain combinations , in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action , the relation between those taking part in it is always the same . 
Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share , and the smaller number a less direct share , in the collective action for which they have combined . 
Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army . 
Every army is composed of lower grades of the service -- the rank and file -- of whom there are always the greatest number ; of the next higher military rank -- corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer , and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer , and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person .
