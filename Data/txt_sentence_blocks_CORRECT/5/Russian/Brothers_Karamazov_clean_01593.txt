They are little children rioting and barring out the teacher at school . 
But their childish delight will end ; it will cost them dear . 
Mankind as a whole has always striven to organise a universal state . 
There have been many great nations with great histories , but the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were , for they felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide union . 
The great conquerors , Timours and Ghenghis-Khans , whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth striving to subdue its people , and they too were but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universal unity .
