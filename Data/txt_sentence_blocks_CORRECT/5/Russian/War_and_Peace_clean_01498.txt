The sound of horse 's hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard , and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared , looming huge as an elephant . 
`` Your honor , the generals ! '' 
said the sergeant , riding up to Rostov . 
Rostov , still looking round toward the fires and the shouts , rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line . 
One was on a white horse .
