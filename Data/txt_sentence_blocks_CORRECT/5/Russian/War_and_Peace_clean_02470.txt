But as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young , and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order , but so softly that I could not hear it . 
Then it seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened . 
We were sitting or lying on the floor . 
He was telling me something , and I wished to show him my sensibility , and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying me . 
And tears came into my eyes , and I was glad he noticed this .
