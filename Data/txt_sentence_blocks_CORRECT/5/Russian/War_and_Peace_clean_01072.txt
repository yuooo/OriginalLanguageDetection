Our fugitives returned , the battalions re-formed , and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed . 
Our reserve units were able to join up , and the fight was at an end . 
The regimental commander and Major Ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge , letting the retreating companies pass by them , when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander 's stirrup , almost leaning against him . 
The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth , he had no knapsack or cap , his head was bandaged , and over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung . 
He had an officer 's sword in his hand .
