Amid the smoke , deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump , Tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun , now aiming , now counting the charges , now giving orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones , and shouting in his feeble voice , so high pitched and irresolute . 
His face grew more and more animated . 
Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight , shouting angrily at the men who , as is always the case , hesitated about lifting the injured or dead . 
The soldiers , for the most part handsome fellows and , as is always the case in an artillery company , a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer -- all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation , and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs . 
Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity , Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear , and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him .
