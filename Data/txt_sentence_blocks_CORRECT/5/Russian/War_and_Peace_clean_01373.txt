Rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie . 
He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened , but imperceptibly , involuntarily , and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood . 
If he had told the truth to his hearers -- who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story -- they would either not have believed him or , still worse , would have thought that Rostov was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him . 
He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood . 
Besides , to tell everything as it really happened , it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened .
