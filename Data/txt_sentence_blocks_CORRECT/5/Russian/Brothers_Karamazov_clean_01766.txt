When the servants came in to him he would say continually , `` Dear , kind people , why are you doing so much for me , do I deserve to be waited on ? 
If it were God 's will for me to live , I would wait on you , for all men should wait on one another . '' 
Mother shook her head as she listened . 
`` My darling , it 's your illness makes you talk like that . ''
