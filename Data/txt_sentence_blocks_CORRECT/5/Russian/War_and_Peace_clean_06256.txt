They were for the most part quite insignificant trifles , but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either , now that he read this diary about his children for the first time . 
Under the date `` 5 '' was entered : Mitya was naughty at table . 
Papa said he was to have no pudding . 
He had none , but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating ! 
I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness .
