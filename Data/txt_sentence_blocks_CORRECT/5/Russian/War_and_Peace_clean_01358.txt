`` Oh , do n't mention it , Count ! 
I quite understand , '' said Berg , getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice . 
`` Go across to our hosts : they invited you , '' added Boris . 
Berg put on the cleanest of coats , without a spot or speck of dust , stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards , in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander , and , having assured himself from the way Rostov looked at it that his coat had been noticed , left the room with a pleasant smile . 
`` Oh dear , what a beast I am ! ''
