The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of , partly because nothing certain was known about it , partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly . 
Rostov lived , as before , with Denisov , and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever . 
Denisov never spoke of Rostov 's family , but by the tender friendship his commander showed him , Rostov felt that the elder hussar 's luckless love for Natasha played a part in strengthening their friendship . 
Denisov evidently tried to expose Rostov to danger as seldom as possible , and after an action greeted his safe return with evident joy . 
On one of his foraging expeditions , in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions , Rostov found a family consisting of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms .
