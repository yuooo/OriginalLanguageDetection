When Eykhen , the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned , appeared , Kutuzov went purple in the face , not because that officer was to blame for the mistake , but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on . 
Trembling and panting the old man fell into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground , and he fell upon Eykhen , threatening him with his hands , shouting and loading him with gross abuse . 
Another man , Captain Brozin , who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame , suffered the same fate . 
`` What sort of another blackguard are you ? 
I 'll have you shot !
