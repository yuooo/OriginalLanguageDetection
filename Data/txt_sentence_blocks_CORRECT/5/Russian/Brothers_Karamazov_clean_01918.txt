The peasants are rotting in drunkenness and can not shake off the habit . 
And what cruelty to their wives , to their children even ! 
All from drunkenness ! 
I 've seen in the factories children of nine years old , frail , rickety , bent and already depraved . 
The stuffy workshop , the din of machinery , work all day long , the vile language and the drink , the drink - is that what a little child 's heart needs ?
