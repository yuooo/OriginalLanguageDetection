I sha n't stop it . 
I told you everything just now , but I did n't tell you this , because even I had not brass enough for it . 
I can still pull up ; if I do , I can give back the full half of my lost honour to-morrow . 
But I sha n't pull up . 
I shall carry out my base plan , and you can bear witness that I told so beforehand .
