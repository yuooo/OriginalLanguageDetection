There was not the least sense in it for either the French or the Russians . 
Its immediate result for the Russians was , and was bound to be , that we were brought nearer to the destruction of Moscow -- which we feared more than anything in the world ; and for the French its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army -- which they feared more than anything in the world . 
What the result must be was quite obvious , and yet Napoleon offered and Kutuzov accepted that battle . 
If the commanders had been guided by reason , it would seem that it must have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army , he was advancing to certain destruction , and it must have been equally clear to Kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow . 
For Kutuzov this was mathematically clear , as it is that if when playing draughts I have one man less and go on exchanging , I shall certainly lose , and therefore should not exchange .
