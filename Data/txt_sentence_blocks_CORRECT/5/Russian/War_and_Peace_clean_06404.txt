Freedom is the content . 
Inevitability is the form . 
Only by separating the two sources of cognition , related to one another as form to content , do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability . 
Only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man 's life . 
Apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as form and content , no conception of life is possible .
