The study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs . 
`` Uncle '' asked his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home , and then went out of the room . 
Rugay , his back still muddy , came into the room and lay down on the sofa , cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth . 
Leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen . 
From behind this came women 's laughter and whispers .
