`` Hold your tongue , I 'll kick you ! '' 
`` I sha n't be altogether sorry , for then my object will be attained . 
If you kick me , you must believe in my reality , for people do n't kick ghosts . 
Joking apart , it does n't matter to me , scold if you like , though it 's better to be a trifle more polite even to me . 
` Fool , flunkey ! '
