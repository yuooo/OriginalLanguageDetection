From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into a corner to read , and yet he was a general favourite all the while he was at school . 
He was rarely playful or merry , but anyone could see at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness . 
On the contrary he was bright and good-tempered . 
He never tried to show off among his schoolfellows . 
Perhaps because of this , he was never afraid of anyone , yet the boys immediately understood that he was not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was bold and courageous .
