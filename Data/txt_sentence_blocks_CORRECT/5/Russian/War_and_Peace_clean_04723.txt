The count , Petya , Madame Schoss , Mavra Kuzminichna , and Vasilich came into the drawing room and , having closed the doors , they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another . 
The count was the first to rise , and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon . 
All the others did the same . 
Then the count embraced Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich , who were to remain in Moscow , and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words . 
The countess went into the oratory and there Sonya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall .
