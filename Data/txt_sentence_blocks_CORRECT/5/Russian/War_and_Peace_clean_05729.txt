One told how he had taken a life , another had taken two , a third had set a house on fire , while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing . 
So they asked the old man : ` What are you being punished for , Daddy ? ' 
-- ` I , my dear brothers , ' said he , ` am being punished for my own and other men 's sins .

I was a merchant , my dear brothers , and had much property .
