The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank , the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right . 
Several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the infantry , who had to wait . 
At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a Russian general . 
The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted , the Austrian argued that not he , but the higher command , was to blame . 
The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited .
