Rostov himself did not know how or why he did it . 
He acted as he did when hunting , without reflecting or considering . 
He saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder ; he knew they could not withstand an attack -- knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return . 
The bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself . 
He touched his horse , gave the word of command , and immediately , hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron , rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons .
