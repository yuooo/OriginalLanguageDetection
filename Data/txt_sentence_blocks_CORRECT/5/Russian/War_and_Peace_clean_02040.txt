Our Order imitates the ancient societies that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics . 
A hieroglyph , '' said the Rhetor , `` is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol . '' 
Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was , but dared not speak . 
He listened to the Rhetor in silence , feeling from all he said that his ordeal was about to begin . 
`` If you are resolved , I must begin your initiation , '' said the Rhetor coming closer to Pierre .
