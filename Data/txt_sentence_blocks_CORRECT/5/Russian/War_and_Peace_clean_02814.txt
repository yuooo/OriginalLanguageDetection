Nicholas , not stopping to talk to the man , asked his sister and Petya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy 's , Ilagin 's , hunting party was . 
The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field , and there , surrounded by inquiring sympathizers , recounted his exploits . 
The facts were that Ilagin , with whom the Rostovs had a quarrel and were at law , hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rostovs , and had now , as if purposely , sent his men to the very woods the Rostovs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased . 
Nicholas , though he had never seen Ilagin , with his usual absence of moderation in judgment , hated him cordially from reports of his arbitrariness and violence , and regarded him as his bitterest foe . 
He rode in angry agitation toward him , firmly grasping his whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his enemy .
