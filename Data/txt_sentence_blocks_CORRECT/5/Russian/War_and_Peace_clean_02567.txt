Her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful -- compared to Helene 's her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped . 
But Helene seemed , as it were , hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned her person , while Natasha was like a girl exposed for the first time , who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary . 
Prince Andrew liked dancing , and wishing to escape as quickly as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him , wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked , caused by the Emperor 's presence , he danced , and had chosen Natasha because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first pretty girl who caught his eye ; but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head , and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers . 
After Prince Andrew , Boris came up to ask Natasha for dance , and then the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball , and several other young men , so that , flushed and happy , and passing on her superfluous partners to Sonya , she did not cease dancing all the evening . 
She noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else .
