I wo n't enlarge upon that now , as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's firstborn , and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him , without which I could not begin my story . 
In the first place , this Mitya , or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch , was the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's three sons who grew up in the belief that he had property , and that he would be independent on coming of age . 
He spent an irregular boyhood and youth . 
He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium , he got into a military school , then went to the Caucasus , was promoted , fought a duel , and was degraded to the ranks , earned promotion again , led a wild life , and spent a good deal of money . 
He did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age , and until then got into debt .
