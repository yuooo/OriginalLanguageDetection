They will be convinced , too , that they can never be free , for they are weak , vicious , worthless , and rebellious . 
Thou didst promise them the bread of Heaven , but , I repeat again , can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes of the weak , ever sinful and ignoble race of man ? 
And if for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee , what is to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of the heavenly ? 
Or dost Thou care only for the tens of thousands of the great and strong , while the millions , numerous as the sands of the sea , who are weak but love Thee , must exist only for the sake of the great and strong ? 
No , we care for the weak too .
