Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity . 
All the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true for him always . 
He not only did not renounce them subsequently , but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance , he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct .
