One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rostov ; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse -LRB- which Rostov fancied he had seen before -RRB- rode up to the ditch , struck his horse with his spurs , and giving it the rein leaped lightly over . 
Only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse 's hind hoofs . 
Turning the horse sharply , he again jumped the ditch , and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes , evidently suggesting that he should do the same . 
The rider , whose figure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily riveted his attention , made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch . 
`` But it ca n't be he , alone in the midst of this empty field ! ''
