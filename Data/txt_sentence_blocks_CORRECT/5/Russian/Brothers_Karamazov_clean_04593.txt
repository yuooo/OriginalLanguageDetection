Those are the prosecutor 's own words . 
So on one side you see a complete absence of precaution , a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright , leaving that clue on the floor , and two minutes later , when he has killed another man , we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating foresight in him . 
But even admitting this was so , it is psychological subtlety , I suppose , that discerns that under certain circumstances I become as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle , while at the next I am as timid and blind as a mole . 
But if I am so bloodthirsty and cruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only run back to find out whether he is alive to witness against me , why should I spend five minutes looking after my victim at the risk of encountering other witnesses ? 
Why soak my handkerchief , wiping the blood off his head so that it may be evidence against me later ?
