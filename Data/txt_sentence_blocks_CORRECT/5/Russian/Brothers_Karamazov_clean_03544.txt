When the homeless old man returned with Grushenka from Mokroe two months before , he had simply stayed on and was still staying with her . 
He arrived with her in rain and sleet , sat down on the sofa , drenched and scared , and gazed mutely at her with a timid , appealing smile . 
Grushenka , who was in terrible grief and in the first stage of fever , almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the first half hour after her arrival . 
Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently : he laughed a pitiful , helpless little laugh . 
She called Fenya and told her to give him something to eat .
