These are the instinctive , plain , and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period . 
For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history , whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves . 
If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that God , to reward or punish his people , gave Napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends , and that reply , would have been clear and complete . 
One might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of Napoleon , but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period , nor would there have been any contradictions . 
But modern history can not give that reply .
