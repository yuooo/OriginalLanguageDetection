Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutuzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army , and Kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces . 
The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of . 
Instead of an offensive , the plan of which , carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics , had been handed to Kutuzov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath , the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from Russia , without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm . 
On the twenty-eighth of October Kutuzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the French . 
On the thirtieth he attacked Mortier 's division , which was on the left bank , and broke it up .
