` Fathers , provoke not your children to wrath , ' the apostle writes , from a heart glowing with love . 
It 's not for the sake of my client that I quote these sacred words , I mention them for all fathers . 
Who has authorised me to preach to fathers ? 
No one . 
But as a man and a citizen I make my appeal - vivos voco !
