But now ? 
Was it the same as then ? 
Now one phantom , one terror at least was at an end : that first , rightful lover , that fateful figure had vanished , leaving no trace . 
The terrible phantom had turned into something so small , so comic ; it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in . 
It would never return .
