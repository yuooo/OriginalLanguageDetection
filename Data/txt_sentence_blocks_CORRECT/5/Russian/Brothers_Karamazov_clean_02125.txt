Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here ; I was bound and sold to him ; Satan brought us together , but there has been no one else . 
But looking at you , I thought , I 'll get him in my clutches and laugh at him . 
You see what a spiteful cur I am , and you called me your sister ! 
And now that man who wronged me has come ; I sit here waiting for a message from him . 
And do you know what that man has been to me ?
