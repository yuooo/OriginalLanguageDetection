Yes , I am the soul of honour , while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else . 
I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind . 
My son , Alexey , is here , being saved . 
I am his father ; I care for his welfare , and it is my duty to care . 
While I 've been playing the fool , I have been listening and having a look on the sly ; and now I want to give you the last act of the performance .
