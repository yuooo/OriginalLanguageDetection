With happy , exhausted faces , they laid the old wolf , alive , on a shying and snorting horse and , accompanied by the dogs yelping at her , took her to the place where they were all to meet . 
The hounds had killed two of the cubs and the borzois three . 
The huntsmen assembled with their booty and their stories , and all came to look at the wolf , which , with her broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws , gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding her . 
When she was touched , she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody . 
Old Count Rostov also rode up and touched the wolf .
