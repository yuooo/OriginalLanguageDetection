From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his science , man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven . 
Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a god . 
His pride will teach him that it 's useless for him to repine at life 's being a moment , and he will love his brother without need of reward . 
Love will be sufficient only for a moment of life , but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire , which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave ' ... and so on and so on in the same style . 
Charming ! ''
