And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted -- that is , how component forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A -- the historian is again obliged to fall back on power -- the force he had denied -- and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces , that is , he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant . 
And that is just what the universal historians do , and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves . 
Peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain , say , according to whether they want rain or fine weather : `` The wind has blown the clouds away , '' or , `` The wind has brought up the clouds . '' 
And in the same way the universal historians sometimes , when it pleases them and fits in with their theory , say that power is the result of events , and sometimes , when they want to prove something else , say that power produces events . 
A third class of historians -- the so-called historians of culture - following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events -- again take that force to be something quite different .
