Fenya , who was still excited by the fright she had had two hours before , and too much `` upset '' to go to bed , was almost frightened into hysterics on hearing the furious knocking at the gate . 
Though she had herself seen him drive away , she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking again , no one else could knock so savagely . 
She ran to the house-porter , who had already waked up and gone out to the gate , and began imploring him not to open it . 
But having questioned Pyotr Ilyitch , and learned that he wanted to see Fenya on very `` important business , '' the man made up his mind at last to open . 
Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenya 's kitchen , but the girl begged him to allow the houseporter to be present , `` because of her misgivings . ''
