People ceased to kill one another , and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power , resistance to Europe , and so on . 
Men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men , and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France , the baseness of England , and so on . 
History shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory , as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights , and the killing of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England . 
But these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day . 
These justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility .
