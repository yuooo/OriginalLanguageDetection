He remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him , he also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses , and above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time . 
On the day of his rescue he had seen the body of Petya Rostov . 
That same day he had learned that Prince Andrew , after surviving the battle of Borodino for more than a month had recently died in the Rostovs ' house at Yaroslavl , and Denisov who told him this news also mentioned Helene 's death , supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before . 
All this at the time seemed merely strange to Pierre : he felt he could not grasp its significance . 
Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another , to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself , rest , and think over all the strange new facts he had learned ; but on reaching Orel he immediately fell ill .
