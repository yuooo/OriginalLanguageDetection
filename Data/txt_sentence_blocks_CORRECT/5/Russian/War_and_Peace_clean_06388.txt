That is the ground which makes the fall of the first man , resulting in the production of the human race , appear evidently less free than a man 's entry into marriage today . 
It is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time can not seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary , the consequences of which are still unknown to me . 
The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it . 
If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those I am in now , my action appears to me undoubtedly free . 
But if I examine an act performed a month ago , then being in different circumstances , I can not help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it - good , agreeable , and even essential -- would not have taken place .
