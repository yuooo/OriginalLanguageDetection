What an eye you 've got , I say ! 
I bet that was when I was talking about the goose . 
That was just when I was fancying you had a great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off , and for a moment I quite hated you for it , and began talking like a fool . 
Then I fancied - just now , here - when I said that if there were no God He would have to be invented , that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge , especially as I got that phrase out of a book . 
But I swear I was n't showing off out of vanity , though I really do n't know why .
