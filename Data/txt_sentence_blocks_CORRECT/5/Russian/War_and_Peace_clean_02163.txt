He has a fit , he is dying , and you come and bleed him and patch him up . 
He will drag about as a cripple , a burden to everybody , for another ten years . 
It would be far easier and simpler for him to die . 
Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is . 
It would be different if you grudged losing a laborer -- that 's how I regard him -- but you want to cure him from love of him .
