The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrushka . 
Lavrushka , understanding that this was done to perplex him and that Napoleon expected him to be frightened , to gratify his new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck , opened his eyes wide , and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped . 
`` As soon as Napoleon 's interpreter had spoken , '' says Thiers , `` the Cossack , seized by amazement , did not utter another word , but rode on , his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the East . 
All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration . 
Napoleon , after making the Cossack a present , had him set free like a bird restored to its native fields . ''
