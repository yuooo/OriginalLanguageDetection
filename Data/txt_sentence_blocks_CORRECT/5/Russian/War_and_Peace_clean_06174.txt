The general opinion was that Pierre was under his wife 's thumb , which was really true . 
From the very first days of their married life Natasha had announced her demands . 
Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife 's view , to him a perfectly novel one , that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family . 
His wife 's demands astonished him , but they also flattered him , and he submitted to them . 
Pierre 's subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with , but dared not even speak smilingly to , any other woman ; did not dare dine at the Club as a pastime , did not dare spend money a whim , and did not dare absent himself for any length of time , except on business -- in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits , which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance .
