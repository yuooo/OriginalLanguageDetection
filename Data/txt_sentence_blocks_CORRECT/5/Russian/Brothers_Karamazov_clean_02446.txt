Plotnikov 's shop was at the corner of the street , next door but one to Pyotr Ilyitch 's . 
It was the largest grocery shop in our town , and by no means a bad one , belonging to some rich merchants . 
They kept everything that could be got in a Petersburg shop , grocery of all sort , wines `` bottled by the brothers Eliseyev , '' fruits , cigars , tea , coffee , sugar , and so on . 
There were three shop-assistants and two errand boys always employed . 
Though our part of the country had grown poorer , the landowners had gone away , and trade had got worse , yet the grocery stores flourished as before , every year with increasing prosperity ; there were plenty of purchasers for their goods .
