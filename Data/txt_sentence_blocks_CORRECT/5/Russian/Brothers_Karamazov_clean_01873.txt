`` Every time I come to you , you look at me so inquisitively as though to say , ` He has still not confessed ! ' 
Wait a bit , do n't despise me too much . 
It 's not such an easy thing to do as you would think . 
Perhaps I shall not do it at all . 
You wo n't go and inform against me then , will you ? ''
