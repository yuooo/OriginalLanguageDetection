When Paris was mentioned , Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections . 
She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city . 
Anatole answered the Frenchwoman very readily and , looking at her with a smile , talked to her about her native land . 
When he saw the pretty little Bourienne , Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either . 
`` Not at all bad ! ''
