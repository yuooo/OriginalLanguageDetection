`` And thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little child , who , playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch , dares to say that , as he does not understand its use , he does not believe in the master who made it . 
To know Him is hard ... . 
For ages , from our forefather Adam to our own day , we labor to attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim ; but in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His greatness ... '' Pierre listened with swelling heart , gazing into the Mason 's face with shining eyes , not interrupting or questioning him , but believing with his whole soul what the stranger said . 
Whether he accepted the wise reasoning contained in the Mason 's words , or believed as a child believes , in the speaker 's tone of conviction and earnestness , or the tremor of the speaker 's voice -- which sometimes almost broke -- or those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction , or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation , which radiated from his whole being -LRB- and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness -RRB- -- at any rate , Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe and he did believe , and felt a joyful sense of comfort , regeneration , and return to life . 
`` He is not to be apprehended by reason , but by life , '' said the Mason .
