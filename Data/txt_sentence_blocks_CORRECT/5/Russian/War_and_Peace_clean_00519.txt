The little princess talked incessantly , her short , downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes . 
She told of an accident they had had on the Spasski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition , and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here ; and that Andrew had quite changed , and that Kitty Odyntsova had married an old man , and that there was a suitor for Mary , a real one , but that they would talk of that later . 
Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness . 
It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law 's words . 
In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother : `` So you are really going to the war , Andrew ? ''
