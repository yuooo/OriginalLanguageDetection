How bright and glorious was the setting sun ! 
With what soft glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone . 
And fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river , the nunnery , the mysterious gorges , and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits ... There was peace and happiness ... `` I should wishing for nothing else , nothing , if only I were there , '' thought Rostov . 
`` In myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness ; but here ... groans , suffering , fear , and this uncertainty and hurry ... There -- they are shouting again , and again are all running back somewhere , and I shall run with them , and it , death , is here above me and around ... Another instant and I shall never again see the sun , this water , that gorge ! 
... '' At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds , and other stretchers came into view before Rostov .
