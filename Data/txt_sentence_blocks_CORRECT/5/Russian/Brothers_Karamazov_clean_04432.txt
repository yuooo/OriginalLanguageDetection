But it was in Katya 's character , and it was such a moment in her life . 
It was the same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of a young profligate to save her father ; the same Katya who had just before , in her pride and chastity , sacrificed herself and her maidenly modesty before all these people , telling of Mitya 's generous conduct , in the hope of softening his fate a little . 
And now , again , she sacrificed herself ; but this time it was for another , and perhaps only now - perhaps only at this moment - she felt and knew how dear that other was to her ! 
She had sacrificed herself in terror for him ; conceiving all of a sudden that he had ruined himself by his confession that it was he who had committed the murder , not his brother , she had sacrificed herself to save him , to save his good name , his reputation ! 
And yet one terrible doubt occurred to one - was she lying in her description of her former relations with Mitya ?
