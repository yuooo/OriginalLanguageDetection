During the hours of solitude , suffering , and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded , the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him , the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life . 
To love everything and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone , not to live this earthly life . 
And the more imbued he became with that principle of love , the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which -- in the absence of such love -- stands between life and death . 
When during those first days he remembered that he would have to die , he said to himself : `` Well , what of it ? 
So much the better ! ''
