In spite of her age and plainness she had gone through the same process as the Rostovs , but with less flurry -- for to her it was a matter of routine . 
Her ugly old body was washed , perfumed , and powdered in just the same way . 
She had washed behind her ears just as carefully , and when she entered her drawing room in her yellow dress , wearing her badge as maid of honor , her old lady 's maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostovs ' servants had been . 
She praised the Rostovs ' toilets . 
They praised her taste and toilet , and at eleven o'clock , careful of their coiffures and dresses , they settled themselves in their carriages and drove off .
