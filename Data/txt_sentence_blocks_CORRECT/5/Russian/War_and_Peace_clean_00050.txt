It was an anecdote , then current , to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George ; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte , who also enjoyed the famous actress ' favors , and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject , and was thus at the duc 's mercy . 
The latter spared him , and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death . 
The story was very pretty and interesting , especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another ; and the ladies looked agitated . 
`` Charming ! '' 
said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess .
