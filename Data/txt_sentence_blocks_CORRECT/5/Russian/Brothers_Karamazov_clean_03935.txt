But I can not omit to mention here that when Ivan , on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha , as I 've related already , told him , `` I am not keen on her , '' it was an absolute lie : he loved her madly , though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered her . 
Many causes helped to bring about this feeling . 
Shattered by what had happened with Mitya , she rushed on Ivan 's return to meet him as her one salvation . 
She was hurt , insulted and humiliated in her feelings . 
And here the man had come back to her , who had loved her so ardently before -LRB- oh !
