But that man has vanquished me . 
He has taken hold of me . 
I could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France . 
When I understood what he wanted -- when I saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us , you know , I said to myself : ` That is a monarch , ' and I devoted myself to him ! 
So there !
