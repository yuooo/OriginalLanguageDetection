The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance , a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him , Stepan Stepanovich Adraksin . 
Adraksin was in uniform , and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a different man . 
With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face , Adraksin shouted at Pierre : `` In the first place , I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor about that , and secondly , if the Russian nobility had that right , the Emperor could not answer such a question . 
The troops are moved according to the enemy 's movements and the number of men increases and decreases ... '' Another voice , that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age , whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies ' and knew as a bad cardplayer , and who , also transformed by his uniform , came up to Pierre , interrupted Adraksin . 
`` Yes , and this is not a time for discussing , '' he continued , `` but for acting : there is war in Russia !
