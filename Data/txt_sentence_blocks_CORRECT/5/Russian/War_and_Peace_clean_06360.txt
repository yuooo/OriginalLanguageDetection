Having restored the condition of time under which all events occur , find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events . 
Restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute , we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding . 
When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it , and as the event results from the collective activity of many people , some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately . 
When one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled , that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it . 
Men are hauling a log .
