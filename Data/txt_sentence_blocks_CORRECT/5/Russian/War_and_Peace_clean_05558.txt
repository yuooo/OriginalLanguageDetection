* * Large battalions are always victorious . 
For military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only : stating that momenta are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal . 
Momentum -LRB- quantity of motion -RRB- is the product of mass and velocity . 
In military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and some unknown x. Military science , seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones , obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it -- now in a geometric formation , now in the equipment employed , now , and most usually , in the genius of the commanders . 
But the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts .
