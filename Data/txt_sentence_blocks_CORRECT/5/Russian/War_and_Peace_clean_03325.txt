On the Arbat Square the troyka caught against a carriage ; something cracked , shouts were heard , and the troyka flew along the Arbat Street . 
After taking a turn along the Podnovinski Boulevard , Balaga began to rein in , and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old Konyusheny Street . 
The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole and Dolokhov went along the pavement .
