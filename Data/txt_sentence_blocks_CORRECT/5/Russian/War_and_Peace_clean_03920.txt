Princess Mary sometimes thought . 
Night and day , hardly sleeping at all , she watched him and , terrible to say , often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end . 
Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself , yet there it was . 
And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her father 's illness began -LRB- perhaps even sooner , when she stayed with him expecting something to happen -RRB- , all the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened . 
Thoughts that had not entered her mind for years -- thoughts of a life free from the fear of her father , and even the possibility of love and of family happiness -- floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the devil .
