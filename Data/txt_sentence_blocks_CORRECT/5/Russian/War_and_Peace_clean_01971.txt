All Denisov 's Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment at the gypsies ' , with the result that he had no recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey . 
After Denisov 's departure , Rostov spent another fortnight in Moscow , without going out of the house , waiting for the money his father could not at once raise , and he spent most of his time in the girls ' room . 
Sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever . 
It was as if she wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her love him all the more , but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of her . 
He filled the girls ' albums with verses and music , and having at last sent Dolokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his receipt , he left at the end of November , without taking leave of any of his acquaintances , to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland .
