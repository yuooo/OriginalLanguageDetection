Smurov picked it up and carried it after him . 
All the boys were crying , and Kolya and the boy who discovered about Troy most of all . 
Though Smurov , with the captain 's hat in his hand , was crying bitterly too , he managed , as he ran , to snatch up a piece of red brick that lay on the snow of the path , to fling it at the flock of sparrows that was flying by . 
He missed them , of course , and went on crying as he ran . 
Half-way , Snegiryov suddenly stopped , stood still for half a minute , as though struck by something , and suddenly turning back to the church , ran towards the deserted grave .
