How could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold ? 
The lower-grade officers and even the soldiers -LRB- who too reason -RRB- also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight , fully convinced as they were of defeat . 
If Bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it , the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue .

Bennigsen , who had chosen the position , warmly displayed his Russian patriotism -LRB- Kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing -RRB- by insisting that Moscow must be defended .
