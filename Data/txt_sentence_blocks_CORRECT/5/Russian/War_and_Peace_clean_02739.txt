The young count paid no heed to them , but , breathing hard , passed by with resolute strides and went into the house . 
The countess , who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the lodge , was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly improve , but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this excitement might have on her son . 
She went several times to his door on tiptoe and listened , as he lighted one pipe after another . 
Next day the old count called his son aside and , with an embarrassed smile , said to him : `` But you know , my dear boy , it 's a pity you got excited ! 
Mitenka has told me all about it . ''
