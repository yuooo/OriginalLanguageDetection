But this little episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch - and a very original one . 
He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his wife ; but not for the second , Alyosha 's mother , the `` crazy woman , '' but for the first , Adelaida Ivanovna , who used to thrash him . 
In the evening of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha . 
He himself was far from being religious ; he had probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint . 
Strange impulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types .
