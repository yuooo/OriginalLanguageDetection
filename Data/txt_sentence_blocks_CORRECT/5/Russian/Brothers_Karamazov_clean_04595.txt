That 's how it must have been , what other reason could he have had for throwing it so far ? 
And if he was capable of feeling grief and pity at having killed a man , it shows that he was innocent of his father 's murder . 
Had he murdered him , he would never have run to another victim out of pity ; then he would have felt differently ; his thoughts would have been centred on self-preservation . 
He would have had none to spare for pity , that is beyond doubt . 
On the contrary , he would have broken his skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him .
