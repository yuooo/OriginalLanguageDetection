Natasha and Pierre , left alone , also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk , that is , with extraordinary clearness and rapidity , understanding and expressing each other 's thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic , without premises , deductions , or conclusions , and in a quite peculiar way . 
Natasha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning . 
When he began proving anything , or talking argumentatively and calmly and she , led on by his example , began to do the same , she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel . 
From the moment they were alone and Natasha came up to him with wide-open happy eyes , and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom , saying : `` Now you are all mine , mine ! 
You wo n't escape ! ''
