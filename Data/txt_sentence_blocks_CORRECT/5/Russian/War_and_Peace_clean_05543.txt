Here as at Tarutino they went after plunder , leaving the men . 
Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon managed to escape . 
When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself in the midst of his army , it was clear that there was nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest , familiar road . 
Napoleon with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint , not feeling his former agility and boldness , and under the influence of the fright the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued orders -- as the historians tell us -- to retreat by the Smolensk road . 
That Napoleon agreed with Mouton , and that the army retreated , does not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat , but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozhaysk -LRB- that is , the Smolensk -RRB- road acted simultaneously on him also .
