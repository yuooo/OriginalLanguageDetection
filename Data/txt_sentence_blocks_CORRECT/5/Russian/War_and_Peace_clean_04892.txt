A French officer , returning from the advanced detachment , rode up to Murat and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there . 
`` Good ! '' 
said Murat and , turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite , ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates . 
The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced up the Arbat . 
When they reached the end of the Vozdvizhenka Street they halted and drew in the Square .
