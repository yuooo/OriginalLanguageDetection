In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever . 
Katerina Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man to be carried to her house , disregarding the inevitable gossip and general disapproval of the public . 
One of two relations who lived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in court , the other remained . 
But if both had gone away , Katerina Ivanovna would have adhered to her resolution , and would have gone on nursing the sick man and sitting by him day and night . 
Varvinsky and Herzenstube were attending him .
