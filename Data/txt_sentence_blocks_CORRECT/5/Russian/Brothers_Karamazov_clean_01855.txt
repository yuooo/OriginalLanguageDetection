He was so base as to take her purse , to open her chest with keys from under her pillow , and to take some things from it , doing it all as it might have been done by an ignorant servant , leaving valuable papers and taking only money . 
He took some of the larger gold things , but left smaller articles that were ten times as valuable . 
He took with him , too , some things for himself as remembrances , but of that later . 
Having done this awful deed . 
he returned by the way he had come .
