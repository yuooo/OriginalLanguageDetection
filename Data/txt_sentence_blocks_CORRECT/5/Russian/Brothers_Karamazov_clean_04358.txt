When they asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to post to her relations , she said firmly , `` I did n't give him the money simply to send it off . 
I felt at the time that he was in great need of money ... . 
I gave him the three thousand on the understanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to . 
There was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards . '' 
I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in detail .
