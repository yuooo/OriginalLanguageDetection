The books he read were chiefly historical , and on these he spent a certain sum every year . 
He was collecting , as he said , a serious library , and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought . 
He would sit in his study with a grave air , reading -- a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty , but which afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters . 
In winter , except for business excursions , he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his children 's relations with their mother . 
The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her .
