The handsome young Emperor Alexander , in the uniform of the Horse Guards , wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back , with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice , attracted everyone 's attention . 
Rostov was not far from the trumpeters , and with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach . 
When he was within twenty paces , and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome , happy young face , he experienced a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known . 
Every trait and every movement of the Tsar 's seemed to him enchanting .
