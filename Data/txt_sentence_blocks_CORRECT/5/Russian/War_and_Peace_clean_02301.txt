On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June , Count Zhilinski arranged a supper for his French friends . 
The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of Napoleon 's , there were also several French officers of the Guard , and a page of Napoleon 's , a young lad of an old aristocratic French family . 
That same day , Rostov , profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress , came to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by Boris and Zhilinski . 
Rostov , in common with the whole army from which he came , was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the French -- who from being foes had suddenly become friends -- that had taken place at headquarters and in Boris . 
In the army , Bonaparte and the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger , contempt , and fear .
