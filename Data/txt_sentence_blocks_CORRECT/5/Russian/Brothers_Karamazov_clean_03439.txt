And it did not take us long to arrange : he stood at the bridle without being noticed , and I stood on one side to direct the goose . 
And the owner was n't looking , he was talking to someone , so I had nothing to do , the goose thrust its head in after the oats of itself , under the cart , just under the wheel . 
I winked at the lad , he tugged at the bridle , and crack . 
The goose 's neck was broken in half . 
And , as luck would have it , all the peasants saw us at that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once .
