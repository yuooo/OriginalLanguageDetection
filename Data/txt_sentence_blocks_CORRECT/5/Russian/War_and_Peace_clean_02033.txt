But since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-purification , not everyone can hope to attain it quickly . 
Hence we have a secondary aim , that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their hearts , to purify and enlighten their minds , by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery , and thereby to render them capable of receiving it . 
`` By purifying and regenerating our members we try , thirdly , to improve the whole human race , offering it in our members an example of piety and virtue , and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which sways the world . 
Think this over and I will come to you again . '' 
`` To combat the evil which sways the world ... '' Pierre repeated , and a mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind .
