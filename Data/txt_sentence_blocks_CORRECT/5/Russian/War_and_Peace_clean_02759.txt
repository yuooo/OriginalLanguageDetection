Each man in the hunt knew his business , his place , what he had to do . 
As soon as they had passed the fence they all spread out evenly and quietly , without noise or talk , along the road and field leading to the Otradnoe covert . 
The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet , now and then splashing into puddles as they crossed a road . 
The misty sky still seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth , the air was still , warm , and silent . 
Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman , the snort of a horse , the crack of a whip , or the whine of a straggling hound could be heard .
