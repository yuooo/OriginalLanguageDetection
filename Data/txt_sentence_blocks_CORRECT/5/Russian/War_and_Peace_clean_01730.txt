There was something naively festive in his air , which , in conjunction with his firm and virile features , gave him a rather comical expression . 
Bekleshev and Theodore Uvarov , who had arrived with him , paused at the doorway to allow him , as the guest of honor , to enter first . 
Bagration was embarrassed , not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy , and this caused some delay at the doors , but after all he did at last enter first . 
He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room , not knowing what to do with his hands ; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire , as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at Schon Grabern -- and he would have found that easier . 
The committeemen met him at the first door and , expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest , took possession of him as it were , without waiting for his reply , surrounded him , and led him to the drawing room .
