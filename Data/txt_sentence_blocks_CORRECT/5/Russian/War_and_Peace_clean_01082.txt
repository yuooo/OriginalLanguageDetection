On the contrary , he became more and more elated . 
It seemed to him that it was a very long time ago , almost a day , since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot , and that the corner of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground . 
Though he thought of everything , considered everything , and did everything the best of officers could do in his position , he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness . 
From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him , the whistle and thud of the enemy 's cannon balls , from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns , from the sight of the blood of men and horses , from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy 's side -LRB- always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth , a man , a gun , a horse -RRB- , from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure . 
The enemy 's guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker .
