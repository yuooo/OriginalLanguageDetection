Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rostovs he had received a letter from Prince Theodore , asking him to come to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal founders . 
On reading that letter -LRB- she always read her husband 's letters -RRB- Natasha herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg , though she would feel his absence very acutely . 
She attributed immense importance to all her husband 's intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them , and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters . 
To Pierre 's timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go , but to fix a definite date for his return . 
He was given four weeks ' leave of absence .
