Kalgonov did to drink , and at first did not care for the girls singing ; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne he became extraordinarily lively , strolling about the room , laughing and praising the music and the songs , admiring everyone and everything . 
Maximov , blissfully drunk , never left his side . 
Grushenka , too , was beginning to get drunk . 
Pointing to Kalganov , she said to Mitya : `` What a dear , charming boy he is ! '' 
And Mitya , delighted , ran to kiss Kalgonov and Maximov .
