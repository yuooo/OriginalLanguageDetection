Two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism and mysticism . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch had been , indeed , carried away by his own eloquence . 
All this had little to do with the case in hand , to say nothing of the fact of its being somewhat vague , but the sickly and consumptive man was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his life . 
People said afterwards that he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticism of Ivan , because the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of him in argument , and Ippolit Kirillovitch , remembering it , tried now to take his revenge . 
But I do n't know whether it was true .
