Christ , the Holy Spirit , Him ! 
... 3rd December Awoke late , read the Scriptures but was apathetic . 
Afterwards went and paced up and down the large hall . 
I wished to meditate , but instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago , when Dolokhov , meeting me in Moscow after our duel , said he hoped I was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife 's absence . 
At the time I gave him no answer .
