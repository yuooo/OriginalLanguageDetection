We 've everything you have , I am revealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you ; though it 's forbidden . 
This legend is about Paradise . 
There was , they say , here on earth a thinker and philosopher . 
He rejected everything , ` laws , conscience , faith , ' and , above all , the future life . 
He died ; he expected to go straight to darkness and death and he found a future life before him .
