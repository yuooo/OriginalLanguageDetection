A general does nothing but command the troops , indicates the objective , and hardly ever uses a weapon himself . 
The commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself , but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops . 
A similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity -- in agriculture , trade , and every administration . 
And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army , or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest , we see a law by which men , to take associated action , combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are , while the less their direct participation in the action itself , the more they command and the fewer of them there are ; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top , who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding . 
This relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power .
