But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent , and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms . 
The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life , with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship , with luxury , and governmental and religious institutions . 
These forms were lifeless but still existed . 
There were bazaars , shops , warehouses , market stalls , granaries -- for the most part still stocked with goods -- and there were factories and workshops , palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries , hospitals , prisons , government offices , churches , and cathedrals . 
The longer the French remained the more these forms of town life perished , until finally all was merged into one confused , lifeless scene of plunder .
