The novelty Anna Pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening was Boris Drubetskoy , who had just arrived as a special messenger from the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage . 
The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that evening was this : `` Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance Bonaparte , and to cause me , and us in general , annoyance and mortification , our opinion of Bonaparte can not alter . 
We shall not cease to express our sincere views on that subject , and can only say to the King Prussia and others : ` So much the worse for you . 
Tu l'as voulu , George Dandin , ' that 's all we have to say about it ! '' 
When Boris , who was to be served up to the guests , entered the drawing room , almost all the company had assembled , and the conversation , guided by Anna Pavlovna , was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and the hope of an alliance with her .
