I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way , for Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses . 
I had a presentiment of it ; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in . 
I showed Pyotr Ilyitch the verses and did n't say who was the author . 
But I am convinced that he guessed , though he wo n't own it to this day , and declares he had no idea . 
But he says that on purpose .
