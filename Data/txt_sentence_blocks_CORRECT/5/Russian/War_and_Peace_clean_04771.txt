There were still people in it , perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained , but it was empty . 
It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty . 
In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives . 
The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives ; from a distance it smells of honey like the others , and bees fly in and out in the same way . 
But one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it .
