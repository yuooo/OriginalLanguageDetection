That reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason . 
If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience , but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable . 
A series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he , as an object of observation , is subject to certain laws , and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them . 
But the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible , and that his every action depends on his organization , his character , and the motives acting upon him ; yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments . 
Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards , a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled .
