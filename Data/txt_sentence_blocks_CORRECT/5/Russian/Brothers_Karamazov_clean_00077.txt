no doubt , in the monastery he fully believed in miracles , but , to my thinking , miracles are never a stumbling-block to the realist . 
It is not miracles that dispose realists to belief . 
The genuine realist , if he is an unbeliever , will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous , and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact . 
Even if he admits it , he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognised by him . 
Faith does not , in the realist , spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith .
