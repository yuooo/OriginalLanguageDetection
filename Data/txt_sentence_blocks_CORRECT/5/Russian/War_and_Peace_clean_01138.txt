`` Do this for my sake , mon cher ; after all , she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased , '' said Prince Vasili to him , handing him a deed to sign for the princess ' benefit . 
Prince Vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone -- a bill for thirty thousand rubles -- to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio . 
Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder . 
The younger sisters also became affectionate to him , especially the youngest , the pretty one with the mole , who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him . 
It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him , and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him , that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him .
