If he had been pleased , but not so much ; if he had not shown it ; if he had begun affecting scruples and difficulties , as other people do when they take money , he might still endure - to take it . 
But he was too genuinely delighted , and that was mortifying . 
Ah , Lise , he is a good and truthful man - that 's the worst of the whole business . 
All the while he talked , his voice was so weak , so broken , he talked so fast , so fast , he kept laughing such a laugh , or perhaps he was crying - yes , I am sure he was crying , he was so delighted - and he talked about his daughters - and about the situation he could get in another town ... . 
And when he had poured out his heart , he felt ashamed at having shown me his inmost soul like that .
