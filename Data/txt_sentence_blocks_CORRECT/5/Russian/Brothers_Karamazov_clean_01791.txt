I only speak from rapture , and forgive my tears , for I love the Bible . 
Let him too weep , the priest of God , and be sure that the hearts of his listeners will throb in response . 
Only a little tiny seed is needed - drop it into the heart of the peasant and it wo n't die , it will live in his soul all his life , it will be hidden in the midst of his darkness and sin , like a bright spot , like a great reminder . 
And there 's no need of much teaching or explanation , he will understand it all simply . 
Do you suppose that the peasants do n't understand ?
