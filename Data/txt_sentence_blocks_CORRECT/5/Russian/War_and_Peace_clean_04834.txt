The inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it . 
Why should that cause the masses to riot ? 
Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town . 
More than ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of September , and except for a mob in the governor 's courtyard , assembled there at his bidding , nothing happened . 
It is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of Borodino , when the surrender of Moscow became certain or at least probable , Rostopchin instead of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics , the gunpowder , munitions , and money , and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned .
