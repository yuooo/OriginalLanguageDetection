Oh , not all Russia , not all ! 
God preserve us , if it were ! 
Yet , here we have her , our mother Russia , the very scent and sound of her . 
Oh , he is spontaneous , he is a marvellous mingling of good and evil , he is a lover of culture and Schiller , yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of his boon companions . 
Oh , he , too , can be good and noble , but only when all goes well with him .
