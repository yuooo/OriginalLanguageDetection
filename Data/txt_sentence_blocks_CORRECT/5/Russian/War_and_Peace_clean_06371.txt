All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question . 
All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question . 
If the will of every man were free , that is , if each man could act as he pleased , all history would be a series of disconnected incidents . 
If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely , that is , as he chose , it is evident that one single free act of that man 's in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity . 
If there be a single law governing the actions of men , free will can not exist , for then man 's will is subject to that law .
