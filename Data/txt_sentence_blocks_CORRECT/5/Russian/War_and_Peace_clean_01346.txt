Berg and Boris , having rested after yesterday 's march , were sitting , clean and neatly dressed , at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them , playing chess . 
Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees . 
Boris , in the accurate way characteristic of him , was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg 's move , and watched his opponent 's face , evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on . 
`` Well , how are you going to get out of that ? '' 
he remarked .
