In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself . 
He had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander . 
Just as he had done after Austerlitz , he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this , and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also . 
In 1809 he was a captain in the Guards , wore medals , and held some special lucrative posts in Petersburg . 
Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg 's merits , it could not be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer , on excellent terms with his superiors , and a moral young man with a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society .
