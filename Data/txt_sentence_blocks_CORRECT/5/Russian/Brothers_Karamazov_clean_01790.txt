For he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the merchants in the burning desert by the well , and how , wringing his hands , he had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a strange land . 
And how , seeing them again after many years , he loved them beyond measure , but he harassed and tormented them in love . 
He left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart , flung himself on his bed and wept . 
Then , wiping his tears away , he went out to them joyful and told them , `` Brothers , I am your brother Joseph '' Let him read them further how happy old Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive , and how he went to Egypt leaving his own country , and died in a foreign land , bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden in his meek and timid heart all his life , that from his offspring , from Judah , will come the great hope of the world , the Messiah and Saviour . 
Fathers and teachers , forgive me and do n't be angry , that like a little child I 've been babbling of what you know long ago , and can teach me a hundred times more skilfully .
