Some columns , supposing they had reached their destination , halted , piled arms , and settled down on the cold ground , but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been . 
Only Count Orlov-Denisov with his Cossacks -LRB- the least important detachment of all -RRB- got to his appointed place at the right time . 
This detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest , on the path leading from the village of Stromilova to Dmitrovsk . 
Toward dawn , Count Orlov-Denisov , who had dozed off , was awakened by a deserter from the French army being brought to him . 
This was a Polish sergeant of Poniatowski 's corps , who explained in Polish that he had come over because he had been slighted in the service : that he ought long ago to have been made an officer , that he was braver than any of them , and so he had left them and wished to pay them out .
