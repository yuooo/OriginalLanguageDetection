It was a warm , rainy , autumnal day . 
The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain , and then , suddenly spread out in the sunlight , far-distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished . 
Down below , the little town could be seen with its white , red-roofed houses , its cathedral , and its bridge , on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops . 
At the bend of the Danube , vessels , an island , and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible , and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests , with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges . 
The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest , and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy 's horse patrols could be discerned .
