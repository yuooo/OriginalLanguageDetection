Oh , I love the dreams of my ardent young friends , quivering with eagerness for life ! 
` There are new men , ' you decided last spring , when you were meaning to come here , ` they propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism . 
Stupid fellows ! 
they did n't ask my advice ! 
I maintain that nothing need be destroyed , that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man , that 's how we have to set to work .
