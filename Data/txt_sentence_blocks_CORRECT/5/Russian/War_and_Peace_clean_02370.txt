The night was fresh , bright , and very still . 
Just before the window was a row of pollard trees , looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other . 
Beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush , wet , bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there . 
Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew , to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches , and above it shone the moon , nearly at its full , in a pale , almost starless , spring sky . 
Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky .
