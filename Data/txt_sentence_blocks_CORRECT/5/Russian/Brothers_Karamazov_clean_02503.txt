And yet , in spite of his resolution , there was confusion in his soul , an agonising confusion : his resolution did not give him peace . 
There was so much behind that tortured him . 
And it seemed strange to him , at moments , to think that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and paper : `` I punish myself , '' and the paper was lying there in his pocket , ready ; the pistol was loaded ; he had already resolved how , next morning , he would meet the first warm ray of `` golden-haired Phoebus . '' 
And yet he could not be quit of the past , of all that he had left behind and that tortured him . 
He felt that miserably , and the thought of it sank into his heart with despair .
