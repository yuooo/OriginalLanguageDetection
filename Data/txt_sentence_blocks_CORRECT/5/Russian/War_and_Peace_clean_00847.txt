In this action for the first time trophies were taken : banners , cannon , and two enemy generals . 
For the first time , after a fortnight 's retreat , the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French . 
Though the troops were ill-clad , exhausted , and had lost a third of their number in killed , wounded , sick , and stragglers ; though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter in which Kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy ; and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded , yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably . 
Throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia , of some victory gained by the Austrians , and of the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte . 
Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian General Schmidt , who was killed in the action .
