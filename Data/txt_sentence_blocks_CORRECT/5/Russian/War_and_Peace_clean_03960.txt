Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting . 
Alpatych named others , but they too , according to Dron , had no horses available : some horses were carting for the government , others were too weak , and others had died for want of fodder .

Alpatych looked intently at Dron and frowned . 
Just as Dron was a model village Elder , so Alpatych had not managed the prince 's estates for twenty years in vain .
