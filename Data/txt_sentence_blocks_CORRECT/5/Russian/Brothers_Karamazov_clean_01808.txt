And , believe me , though it 's forty years ago , I recall it now with shame and pain . 
I went to bed and slept for about three hours ; when I waked up the day was breaking . 
I got up - I did not want to sleep any more - I went to the window - opened it , it looked out upon the garden ; I saw the sun rising ; it was warm and beautiful , the birds were singing . 
`` What 's the meaning of it ? '' 
I thought .
