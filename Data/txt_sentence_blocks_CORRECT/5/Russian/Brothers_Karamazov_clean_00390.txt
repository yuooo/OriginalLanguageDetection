If something happens later on , it 'll be : ` Ah , the holy man foresaw it , prophesied it ! ' 
though it 's a poor sort of prophecy , flopping like that . 
` Ah , but it was symbolic , ' they 'll say , ` an allegory , ' and the devil knows what all ! 
It 'll be remembered to his glory : ` He predicted the crime and marked the criminal ! ' 
That 's always the way with these crazy fanatics ; they cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple .
