He had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so pleased at Olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general , and according to which what was needed for success in the service was not effort or work , or courage , or perseverance , but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards , and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to understand these things . 
In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life , all his relations with old friends , all his plans for his future , were completely altered . 
He was not rich , but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others , and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform . 
He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him . 
He liked Petersburg and despised Moscow .
