Oh , yes , we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom , but then , in our great sorrow , we shall rise again to joy , without which man can not live nor God exist , for God gives joy : it 's His privilege - a grand one . 
Ah , man should be dissolved in prayer ! 
What should I be underground there without God ? 
Rakitin 's laughing ! 
If they drive God from the earth , we shall shelter Him underground .
