Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth , and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him . 
He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution , which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain ! 
We alone must avenge the blood of the just one ... . 
Whom , I ask you , can we rely on ? 
... England with her commercial spirit will not and can not understand the Emperor Alexander 's loftiness of soul .
