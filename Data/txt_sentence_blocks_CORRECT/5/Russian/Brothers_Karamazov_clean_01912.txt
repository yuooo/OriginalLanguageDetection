And therefore the idea of the service of humanity , of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind , is more and more dying out in the world , and indeed this idea is sometimes treated with derision . 
For how can a man shake off his habits ? 
What can become of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the innumerable desires he has created for himself ? 
He is isolated , and what concern has he with the rest of humanity ? 
They have succeeded in accumulating a greater mass of objects , but the joy in the world has grown less .
