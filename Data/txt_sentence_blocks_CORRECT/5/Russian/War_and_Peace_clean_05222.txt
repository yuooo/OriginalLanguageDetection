An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin 's Field . 
It was a fine day , sunny after rain , and the air was unusually pure . 
The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart , but rose through the pure air in columns . 
No flames were seen , but columns of smoke rose on all sides , and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin . 
On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing , and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses .
