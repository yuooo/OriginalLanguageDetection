Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms , the hussars formed line for roll call , kept things in order , groomed their horses , polished their arms , brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder , and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry , joking about their nasty food and their hunger . 
As usual , in their spare time , they lit bonfires , steamed themselves before them naked ; smoked , picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes , told and listened to stories of Potemkin 's and Suvorov 's campaigns , or to legends of Alesha the Sly , or the priest 's laborer Mikolka . 
The officers , as usual , lived in twos and threes in the roofless , half-ruined houses . 
The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and , in general , food for the men . 
The younger ones occupied themselves as before , some playing cards -LRB- there was plenty of money , though there was no food -RRB- , some with more innocent games , such as quoits and skittles .
