His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet . 
As a mark of the commander in chief 's special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court , now no longer at Vienna -LRB- which was threatened by the French -RRB- but at Brunn . 
Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men , and on the night of the battle , having arrived at Krems excited but not weary , with dispatches from Dokhturov to Kutuzov , he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brunn . 
To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion . 
The night was dark but starry , the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day -- the day of the battle .
