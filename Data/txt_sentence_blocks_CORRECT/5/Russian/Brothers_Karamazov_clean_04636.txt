`` Gentlemen of the jury , is that really so ? 
Is it positively , actually true that there is no one else at all ? 
We 've heard the prosecutor count on his fingers all the persons who were in that house that night . 
They were five in number ; three of them , I agree , could not have been responsible - the murdered man himself , old Grigory , and his wife . 
There are left then the prisoner and Smerdyakov , and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix on , that had there been a sixth person , even a phantom of a sixth person , he would have abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have accused that other .
