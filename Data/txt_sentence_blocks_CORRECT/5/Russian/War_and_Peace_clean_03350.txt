From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go away somewhere , so as not to be near her . 
Soon after the Rostovs came to Moscow the effect Natasha had on him made him hasten to carry out his intention . 
He went to Tver to see Joseph Alexeevich 's widow , who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased husband 's . 
When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Marya Dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance relating to Andrew Bolkonski and his betrothed . 
Pierre had been avoiding Natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her was stronger than a married man 's should be for his friend 's fiancee .
