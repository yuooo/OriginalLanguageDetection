The reasons on which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression . 
In fact , the ambassador , as he himself has declared , was never authorized to make that demand , and as soon as I was informed of it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post . 
If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding , and consents to withdraw your troops from Russian territory , I will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible . 
In the contrary case , Your Majesty , I shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked . 
It still depends on Your Majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war .
