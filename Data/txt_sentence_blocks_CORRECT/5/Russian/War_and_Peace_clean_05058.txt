As he was going along a foot path across a wide-open space adjoining the Povarskoy on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruzinski 's house on the other , Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him . 
He stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head . 
By the side of the path , on the dusty dry grass , all sorts of household goods lay in a heap : featherbeds , a samovar , icons , and trunks . 
On the ground , beside the trunks , sat a thin woman no longer young , with long , prominent upper teeth , and wearing a black cloak and cap . 
This woman , swaying to and fro and muttering something , was choking with sobs .
