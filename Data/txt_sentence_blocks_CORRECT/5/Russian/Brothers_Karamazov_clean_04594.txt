If he were so cold-hearted and calculating , why not hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as to kill him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness ? 
`` Again , though he ran to see whether the witness was alive , he left another witness on the path , that brass pestle which he had taken from the two women , and which they could always recognise afterwards as theirs , and prove that he had taken it from them . 
And it is not as though he had forgotten it on the path , dropped it through carelessness or haste , no , he had flung away his weapon , for it was found fifteen paces from where Grigory lay . 
Why did he do so ? 
just because he was grieved at having killed a man , an old servant ; and he flung away the pestle with a curse , as a murderous weapon .
