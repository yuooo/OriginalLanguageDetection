Denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger -LRB- none of them had eaten anything since morning -RRB- , and yet more because he still had no news from Dolokhov and the man sent to capture a `` tongue '' had not returned . 
`` There 'll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today . 
It 's too risky to attack them by oneself , and if we put it off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey from under our noses , '' thought Denisov , continually peering forward , hoping to see a messenger from Dolokhov . 
On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the right , Denisov stopped .
