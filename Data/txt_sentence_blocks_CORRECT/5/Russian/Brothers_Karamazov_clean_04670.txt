Let not a man 's soul be lost through us ! 
`` I asked just now what does ` father ' mean , and exclaimed that it was a great word , a precious name . 
But one must use words honestly , gentlemen , and I venture to call things by their right names : such a father as old Karamazov can not be called a father and does not deserve to be . 
Filial love for an unworthy father is an absurdity , an impossibility . 
Love can not be created from nothing : only God can create something from nothing . ''
