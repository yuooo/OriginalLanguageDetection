Rostov had become a bluff , good-natured fellow , whom his Moscow acquaintances would have considered rather bad form , but who was liked and respected by his comrades , subordinates , and superiors , and was well contented with his life . 
Of late , in 1809 , he found in letters from home more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder , and that it was time for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents . 
Reading these letters , Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take him away from surroundings in which , protected from all the entanglements of life , he was living so calmly and quietly . 
He felt that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life , with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out , its accounts with stewards , quarrels , and intrigues , its ties , society , and with Sonya 's love and his promise to her . 
It was all dreadfully difficult and complicated ; and he replied to his mother in cold , formal letters in French , beginning : `` My dear Mamma , '' and ending : `` Your obedient son , '' which said nothing of when he would return .
