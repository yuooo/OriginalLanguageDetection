In his account , Father Zossima 's talk goes on without interruption , as though he told his life to his friends in the form of a story , though there is no doubt , from other accounts of it , that the conversation that evening was general . 
Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much , yet they too talked , perhaps even told something themselves . 
Besides , Father Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative , for he was sometimes gasping for breath , his voice failed him , and he even lay down to rest on his bed , though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats . 
Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by Father Paissy 's reading the Gospel . 
It is worthy of note , too , that no one of them supposed that he would die that night , for on that evening of his life after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength , which kept him up through this long conversation .
