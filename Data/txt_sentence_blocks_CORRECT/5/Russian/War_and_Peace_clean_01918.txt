And I did not realize how happy I was ! 
When did that end and when did this new , terrible state of things begin ? 
What marked the change ? 
I sat all the time in this same place at this table , chose and placed cards , and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the same way . 
When did it happen and what has happened ?
