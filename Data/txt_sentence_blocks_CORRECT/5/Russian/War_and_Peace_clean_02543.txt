The two girls in their white dresses , each with a rose in her black hair , both curtsied in the same way , but the hostess ' eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natasha . 
She looked at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess . 
Looking at her she may have recalled the golden , irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball . 
The host also followed Natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter . 
`` Charming ! ''
