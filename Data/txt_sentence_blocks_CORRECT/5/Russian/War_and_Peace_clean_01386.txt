One voice was heard shouting : `` Eyes front ! '' 
Then , like the crowing of cocks at sunrise , this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent . 
In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard . 
This was the Emperors ' suites . 
The Emperors rode up to the flank , and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march .
