Though Mitya knew the merchant by sight , he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him . 
But for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction that the old reprobate , who was lying at death 's door , would perhaps not at all object now to Grushenka 's securing a respectable position , and marrying a man `` to be depended upon . ''
