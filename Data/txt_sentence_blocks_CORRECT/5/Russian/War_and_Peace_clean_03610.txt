To ride this horse was a pleasure to him , and he thought of the horse , of the morning , of the doctor 's wife , but not once of the impending danger . 
Formerly , when going into action , Rostov had felt afraid ; now he had not the least feeling of fear . 
He was fearless , not because he had grown used to being under fire -LRB- one can not grow used to danger -RRB- , but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger . 
He had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him -- the impending danger . 
During the first period of his service , hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice , he had not been able to do this , but with time it had come of itself .
