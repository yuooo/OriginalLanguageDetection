`` You see , I know he ca n't bear me , nor anyone else , even you , though you fancy that he has a high opinion of you . 
Worse still with Alyosha , he despises Alyosha . 
But he does n't steal , that 's one thing , and he 's not a gossip , he holds his tongue , and does n't wash our dirty linen in public . 
He makes capital fish pasties too . 
But , damn him , is he worth talking about so much ? ''
