The carts , in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting , jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road . 
The wounded , bandaged with rags , with pale cheeks , compressed lips , and knitted brows , held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another . 
Almost all of them stared with naive , childlike curiosity at Pierre 's white hat and green swallow-tail coat . 
Pierre 's coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road . 
The cavalry regiment , as it descended the hill with its singers , surrounded Pierre 's carriage and blocked the road .
