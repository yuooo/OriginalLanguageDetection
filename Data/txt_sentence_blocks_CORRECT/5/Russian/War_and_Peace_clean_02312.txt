Rostov had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on Denisov 's behalf . 
He could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so , and Boris , even had he wished to , could not have done so on the following day . 
On that day , June 27 , the preliminaries of peace were signed . 
The Emperors exchanged decorations : Alexander received the Cross of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the First Degree , and a dinner had been arranged for the evening , given by a battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazhensk battalion . 
The Emperors were to be present at that banquet .
