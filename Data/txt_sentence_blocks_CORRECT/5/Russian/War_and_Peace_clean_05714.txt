During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was Pierre . 
On the twenty-second of October that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left Moscow . 
Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by Cossacks , the other half had gone on ahead . 
Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was left ; they had all disappeared . 
The artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by Marshal Junot 's enormous baggage train , convoyed by Westphalians .
