Natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once had time to think of what lay before her . 
In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage , she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at the ball , in those brightly lighted rooms -- with music , flowers , dances , the Emperor , and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg . 
The prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true , so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the carriage . 
She understood all that awaited her only when , after stepping over the red baize at the entrance , she entered the hall , took off her fur cloak , and , beside Sonya and in front of her mother , mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers . 
Only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball , and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion .
