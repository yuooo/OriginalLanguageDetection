You had much better look at her - do you see how she has pity on me ? 
I came here to find a wicked soul - I felt drawn to evil because I was base and evil myself , and I 've found a true sister ; I have found a treasure - a loving heart . 
She had pity on me just now ... . 
Agrafena Alexandrovna , I am speaking of you . 
You 've raised my soul from the depths . ''
