`` That 's just it , my dear fellow . 
You see it 's hurrah for the Tsar , for Russia , for the Orthodox Greek faith ! 
All that is beautiful , but what do we , I mean the Austrian court , care for your victories ? 
Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand -LRB- one archduke 's as good as another , as you know -RRB- and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte 's , that will be another story and we 'll fire off some cannon ! 
But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us .
