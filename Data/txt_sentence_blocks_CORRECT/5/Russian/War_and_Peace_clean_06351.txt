Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters Russia . 
Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the Bourbons . 
Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it . 
The historians , in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs , want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power , but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience . 
On the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man 's will -- his words -- are only part of the general activity expressed in an event , as for instance in a war or a revolution , and so without assuming an incomprehensible , supernatural force -- a miracle -- one can not admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men .
