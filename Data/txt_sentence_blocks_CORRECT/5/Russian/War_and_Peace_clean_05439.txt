`` The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage , parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning to the Kremlin . 
Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening , last night , and today .

Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers , and have abused and beaten them . ''
