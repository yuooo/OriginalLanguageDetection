I 'm like the philosopher , Diderot , your reverence . 
Did you ever hear , most Holy Father , how Diderot went to see the Metropolitan Platon , in the time of the Empress Catherine ? 
He went in and said straight out , ` There is no God . ' 
To which the great bishop lifted up his finger and answered , ` The fool has said in his heart there is no God and he fell down at his feet on the spot . ' 
I believe , ' he cried , ` and will be christened . '
