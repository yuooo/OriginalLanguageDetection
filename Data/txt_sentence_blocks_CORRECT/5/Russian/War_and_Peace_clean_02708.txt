You know me and my relations with Father . 
I want nothing from him . 
I have been and always shall be independent ; but to go against his will and arouse his anger , now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time , would destroy half my happiness . 
I am now writing to him about the same question , and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months . '' 
After long hesitations , doubts , and prayers , Princess Mary gave the letter to her father .
