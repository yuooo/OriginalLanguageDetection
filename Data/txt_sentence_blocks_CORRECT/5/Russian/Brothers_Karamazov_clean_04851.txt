Let us make a compact here , at Ilusha 's stone , that we will never forget Ilusha and one another . 
And whatever happens to us later in life , if we do n't meet for twenty years afterwards , let us always remember how we buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones , do you remember , by the bridge ? 
and afterwards we all grew so fond of him . 
He was a fine boy , a kindhearted , brave boy , he felt for his father 's honour and resented the cruel insult to him and stood up for him . 
And so in the first place , we will remember him , boys , all our lives .
