The cares of preparation and giving orders , for which everyone came to her , occupied her all day . 
She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual , without undressing , in the room next to the one where the prince lay . 
Several times , waking up , she heard his groans and muttering , the creak of his bed , and the steps of Tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over . 
Several times she listened at the door , and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener . 
She could not sleep and several times went to the door and listened , wishing to enter but not deciding to do so .
