The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint : he will not be wanted any more . 
And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his island , justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed , and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions . 
The manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor shows him to us . 
`` See what you believed in ! 
This is he !
