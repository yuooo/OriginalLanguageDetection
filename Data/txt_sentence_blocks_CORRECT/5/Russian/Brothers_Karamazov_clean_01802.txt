I was fond of reading , yet strange to say , the Bible was the one book I never opened at that time , though I always carried it about with me , and I was never separated from it ; in very truth I was keeping that book `` for the day and the hour , for the month and the year , '' though I knew it not .

We found the people of the town hospitable , rich , and fond of entertainments . 
I met with a cordial reception everywhere , as I was of a lively temperament and was known to be well off , which always goes a long way in the world . 
And then a circumstance happened which was the beginning of it all .
