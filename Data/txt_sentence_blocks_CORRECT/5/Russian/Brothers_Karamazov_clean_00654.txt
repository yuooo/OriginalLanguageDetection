And though I 'm a beggar , as fate would have it , I had three thousand just then in my pocket . 
I drove with Grushenka to Mokroe , a place twenty-five versts from here . 
I got Gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there drunk on it , and all the women and girls . 
I sent the thousands flying . 
In three days ' time I was stripped bare , but a hero .
