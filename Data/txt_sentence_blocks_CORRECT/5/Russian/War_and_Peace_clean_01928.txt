To say `` tomorrow '' and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult , but to go home alone , see his sisters , brother , mother , and father , confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor , was terrible . 
At home , they had not yet gone to bed . 
The young people , after returning from the theater , had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord . 
As soon as Nicholas entered , he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love which pervaded the Rostov household that winter and , now after Dolokhov 's proposal and Iogel 's ball , seemed to have grown thicker round Sonya and Natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm . 
Sonya and Natasha , in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater , looking pretty and conscious of it , were standing by the clavichord , happy and smiling .
