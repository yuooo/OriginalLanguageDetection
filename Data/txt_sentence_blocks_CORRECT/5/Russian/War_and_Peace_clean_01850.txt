Two hours later Prince Andrew , stepping softly , went into his father 's room . 
The old man already knew everything . 
He was standing close to the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise round his son 's neck , and without a word he began to sob like a child . 
Three days later the little princess was buried , and Prince Andrew went up the steps to where the coffin stood , to give her the farewell kiss . 
And there in the coffin was the same face , though with closed eyes .
