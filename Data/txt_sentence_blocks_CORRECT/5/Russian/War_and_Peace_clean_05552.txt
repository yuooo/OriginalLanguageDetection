Moscow is taken and after that , with no further battles , it is not Russia that ceases to exist , but the French army of six hundred thousand , and then Napoleonic France itself . 
To strain the facts to fit the rules of history : to say that the field of battle at Borodino remained in the hands of the Russians , or that after Moscow there were other battles that destroyed Napoleon 's army , is impossible . 
After the French victory at Borodino there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious , yet the French army ceased to exist . 
What does this mean ? 
If it were an example taken from the history of China , we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon -LRB- which is the historians ' usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards -RRB- ; if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part , we might treat it as an exception ; but this event occurred before our fathers ' eyes , and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland , and it happened in the greatest of all known wars .
