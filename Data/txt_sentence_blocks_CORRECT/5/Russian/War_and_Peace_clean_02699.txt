But not to speak of her alone , that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief . 
Then , at the moment of our loss , these thoughts could not occur to me ; I should then have dismissed them with horror , but now they are very clear and certain . 
I write all this to you , dear friend , only to convince you of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life : not a single hair of our heads will fall without His will . 
And His will is governed only by infinite love for us , and so whatever befalls us is for our good . 
You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow .
