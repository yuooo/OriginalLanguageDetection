And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave , she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch , ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag . 
As the foreman of a spinning mill , when he has set the hands to work , goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should , and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion , so Anna Pavlovna moved about her drawing room , approaching now a silent , now a too-noisy group , and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady , proper , and regular motion . 
But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident . 
She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there , and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe .
