That 's my advice : never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of , and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is , or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake . 
Marry when you are old and good for nothing -- or all that is good and noble in you will be lost . 
It will all be wasted on trifles . 
Yes ! 
Yes !
