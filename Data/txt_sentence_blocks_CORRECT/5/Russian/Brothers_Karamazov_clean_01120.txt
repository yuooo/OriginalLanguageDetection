Mamma , how slow you always are , how can you be so long ! 
And here 's Yulia with the ice ! 
`` Oh , Lise , do n't scream , above all things do n't scream . 
That scream drives me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place ? 
I 've been hunting and hunting - I do believe you did it on purpose . ''
