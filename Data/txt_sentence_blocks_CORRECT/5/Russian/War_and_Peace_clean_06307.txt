In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris ; it grows , spreads , and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east . 
Several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward . 
In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit , Moscow , and then , with remarkable symmetry , a countermovement occurs from east to west , attracting to it , as the first movement had done , the nations of middle Europe . 
The counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west -- Paris -- and subsides . 
During that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left untilled , houses were burned , trade changed its direction , millions of men migrated , were impoverished , or were enriched , and millions of Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another .
