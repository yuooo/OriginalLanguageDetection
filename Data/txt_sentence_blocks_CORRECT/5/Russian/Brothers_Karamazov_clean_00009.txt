And just at that time his wife 's family received the news of her death in Petersburg . 
She had died quite suddenly in a garret , according to one story , of typhus , or as another version had it , of starvation . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife 's death , and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy , raising his hands to Heaven : `` Lord , now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace , '' but others say he wept without restraint like a little child , so much so that people were sorry for him , in spite of the repulsion he inspired . 
It is quite possible that both versions were true , that he rejoiced at his release , and at the same time wept for her who released him . 
As a general rule , people , even the wicked , are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose .
