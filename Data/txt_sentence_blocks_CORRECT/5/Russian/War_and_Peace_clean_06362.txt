When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who , because their activity is given to directing and commanding , take less less part in the direct work . 
When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity , justify his present activity , and guide him in planning his future actions . 
Just the same is done by a concourse of people , allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations , justifications , and surmises concerning their collective activity . 
For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill one another . 
And corresponding to the event its justification appears in people 's belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France , for liberty , and for equality .
