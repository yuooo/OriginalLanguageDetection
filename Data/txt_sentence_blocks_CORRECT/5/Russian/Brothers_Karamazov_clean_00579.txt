I threw away money by the handful on music , rioting , and Gypsies . 
Sometimes I gave it to the ladies , too , for they 'll take it greedily , that must be admitted , and be pleased and thankful for it . 
Ladies used to be fond of me : not all of them , but it happened , it happened . 
But I always liked side-paths , little dark back-alleys behind the main road - there one finds adventures and surprises , and precious metal in the dirt . 
I am speaking figuratively , brother .
