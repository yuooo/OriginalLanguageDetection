Strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks , her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully . 
Prince Andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying . 
Her glittering eyes , filled with childlike fear and excitement , rested on him without changing their expression . 
`` I love you all and have done no harm to anyone ; why must I suffer so ? 
Help me ! ''
