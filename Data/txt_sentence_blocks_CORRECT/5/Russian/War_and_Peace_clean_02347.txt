The smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections ; he had to get something to eat before going away . 
He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning . 
There he found so many people , among them officers who , like himself , had come in civilian clothes , that he had difficulty in getting a dinner . 
Two officers of his own division joined him . 
The conversation naturally turned on the peace .
