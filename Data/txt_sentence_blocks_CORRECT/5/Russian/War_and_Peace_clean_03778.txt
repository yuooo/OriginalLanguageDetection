The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and , instead of sleeping in his study as usual , changed his sleeping place every day . 
One day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery , another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing , while -- instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne -- a serf boy read to him . 
Then again he would spend a night in the dining room . 
On August 1 , a second letter was received from Prince Andrew . 
In his first letter which came soon after he had left home , Prince Andrew had dutifully asked his father 's forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor .
