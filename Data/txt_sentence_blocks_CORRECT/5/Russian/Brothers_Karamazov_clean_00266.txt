In my dreams , ' he said , ' I have often come to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity , and perhaps I might actually have faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary ; and yet I am incapable of living in the same room with anyone for two days together , as I know by experience . 
As soon as anyone is near me , his personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom . 
In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men : one because he 's too long over his dinner ; another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing his nose .
