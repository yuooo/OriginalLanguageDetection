Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it . 
But , coming toward him , he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf . 
There was still hope . 
A long , yellowish young borzoi , one Nicholas did not know , from another leash , rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over . 
But the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and , gnashing her teeth , flew at the yellowish borzoi , which , with a piercing yelp , fell with its head on the ground , bleeding from a gash in its side .
