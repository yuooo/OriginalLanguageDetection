We can not accurately estimate his genius in Austria or Prussia , for we have to draw our information from French or German sources , and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in Germany . 
But we , thank God , have no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame . 
We have paid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply , and we will not abandon that right . 
His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere . 
Order after order order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it .
