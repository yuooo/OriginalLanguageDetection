`` Once in olden times a holy saint saw in the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one , her only one , whom God had taken . 
` Knowest thou not , ' said the saint to her , ` how bold these little ones are before the throne of God ? 
Verily there are none bolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven . 
`` Thou didst give us life , O Lord , '' they say , `` and scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou didst take it back again . '' 
And so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them at once the rank of angels .
