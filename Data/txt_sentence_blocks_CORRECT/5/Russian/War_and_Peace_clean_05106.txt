In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles , between the parties of Rumyantsev , the French , Marya Fedorovna , the Tsarevich , and others , drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones .

Stories were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances .
