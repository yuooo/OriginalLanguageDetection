A bee settling on a flower has stung a child . 
And the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people . 
A poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers . 
A beekeeper , seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive , says that it exists to gather honey . 
Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen , and that it exists to perpetuate its race .
