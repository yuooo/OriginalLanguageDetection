Prince Bagration was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses . 
The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood , mustered the men who were woodcutting , and , allowing the French to pass him , had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French troops . 
`` When I saw , your excellency , that their first battalion was disorganized , I stopped in the road and thought : ` I 'll let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion ' -- and that 's what I did . '' 
The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened . 
Perhaps it might really have been so ?
