The whole day had been hot . 
Somewhere a storm was gathering , but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly , sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves . 
The left side of the forest was dark in the shade , the right side glittered in the sunlight , wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze . 
Everything was in blossom , the nightingales trilled , and their voices reverberated now near , now far away . 
`` Yes , here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed , '' thought Prince Andrew .
