`` Listen , '' Ivan suddenly got up from the table . 
`` I seem to be delirious ... I am delirious , in fact , talk any nonsense you like , I do n't care ! 
You wo n't drive me to fury , as you did last time . 
But I feel somehow ashamed ... I want to walk about the room ... . 
I sometimes do n't see you and do n't even hear your voice as I did last time , but I always guess what you are prating , for it 's I , I myself speaking , not you .
