Rostov no longer looked at the colonel , he had no time . 
He was afraid of falling behind the hussars , so much afraid that his heart stood still . 
His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly 's charge , and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud . 
Denisov rode past him , leaning back and shouting something . 
Rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him , their spurs catching and their sabers clattering .
