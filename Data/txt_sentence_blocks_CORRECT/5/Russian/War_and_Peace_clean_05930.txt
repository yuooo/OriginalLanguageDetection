`` It 's a pleasure to talk to a man like that ; he is not like our provincials , '' he would say . 
There were several prisoners from the French army in Orel , and the doctor brought one of them , a young Italian , to see Pierre . 
This officer began visiting Pierre , and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the Italian expressed for him . 
The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre , talk with him , tell him about his past , his life at home , and his love , and pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially against Napoleon . 
`` If all Russians are in the least like you , it is sacrilege to fight such a nation , '' he said to Pierre .
