`` Stretchers ! '' 
shouted someone behind him . 
Rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant ; he ran on , trying only to be ahead of the others ; but just at the bridge , not looking at the ground , he came on some sticky , trodden mud , stumbled , and fell on his hands . 
The others outstripped him . 
`` At boss zides , Captain , '' he heard the voice of the colonel , who , having ridden ahead , had pulled up his horse near the bridge , with a triumphant , cheerful face .
