`` It 's now two o'clock and you dine at four . 
There will just be time . '' 
And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time , Anna Mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son , and went into the anteroom with him . 
`` Good-by , my dear , '' said she to the countess who saw her to the door , and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear , `` Wish me good luck . '' 
`` Are you going to Count Cyril Vladimirovich , my dear ? ''
