I maintain that he is in his right mind , and that if he had not been , he would have behaved more cleverly . 
As for his being a maniac , that I would agree with , but only in one point , that is , his fixed idea about the three thousand . 
Yet I think one might find a much simpler cause than his tendency to insanity . 
For my part I agree thoroughly with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner 's mental faculties have always been normal , and that he has only been irritable and exasperated . 
The object of the prisoner 's continual and violent anger was not the sum itself ; there was a special motive at the bottom of it .
