The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking . 
He neither smoked nor talked , but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors , whom he egged on against each other . 
One of them was a sallow , clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face , already growing old , though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man . 
He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and , having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth , was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes . 
This was an old bachelor , Shinshin , a cousin of the countess ' , a man with `` a sharp tongue '' as they said in Moscow society .
