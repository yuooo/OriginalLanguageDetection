Be not comforted . 
Consolation is not what you need . 
Weep and be not consoled , but weep . 
Only every time that you weep be sure to remember that your little son is one of the angels of God , that he looks down from there at you and sees you , and rejoices at your tears , and points at them to the Lord God ; and a long while yet will you keep that great mother 's grief . 
But it will turn in the end into quiet joy , and your bitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart and delivers it from sin .
