In the second statement we heard only cries of resentment and revenge , cries of long-concealed hatred . 
And the very fact that the witness gave her first evidence incorrectly gives us a right to conclude that her second piece of evidence may have been incorrect also . 
The prosecutor will not , dare not -LRB- his own words -RRB- touch on that story . 
So be it . 
I will not touch on it either , but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and high-principled person , such as that highly respected young lady unquestionably is , if such a person , I say , allows herself suddenly in court to contradict her first statement , with the obvious motive of ruining the prisoner , it is clear that this evidence has been given not impartially , not coolly .
