In Natasha 's receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her strongly . 
She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over Amalek , of Gideon over Midian , and of David over Goliath , and about the destruction of `` Thy Jerusalem , '' and she prayed to God with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing , but without fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer . 
She shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness , for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope , and its animation by love . 
But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them . 
But neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees .
