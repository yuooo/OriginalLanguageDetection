Ever since that leave of absence had expired , more than a fortnight before , Natasha had been in a constant state of alarm , depression , and irritability . 
Denisov , now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the present state of affairs , had arrived during that fortnight . 
He looked at Natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once dear . 
A dull , dejected look , random replies , and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress . 
Natasha was sad and irritable all that time , especially when her mother , her brother , Sonya , or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning .
