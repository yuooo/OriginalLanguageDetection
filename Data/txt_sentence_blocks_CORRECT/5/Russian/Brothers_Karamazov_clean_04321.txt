When he was asked to explain how it was apparent now at this moment , the old doctor , with simple-hearted directness , pointed out that the prisoner had `` an extraordinary air , remarkable in the circumstances '' ; that he had `` marched in like a soldier , looking straight before him , though it would have been more natural for him to look to the left where , among the public , the ladies were sitting , seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex and must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now , '' the old man concluded in his peculiar language . 
I must add that he spoke Russian readily , but every phrase was formed in German style , which did not , however , trouble him , for it had always been a weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian perfectly , better indeed than Russians . 
And he was very fond of using Russian proverbs , always declaring that the Russian proverbs were the best and most expressive sayings in the whole world . 
I may remark , too , that in conversation , through absent-mindedness he often forgot the most ordinary words , which sometimes went out of his head , though he knew them perfectly . 
The same thing happened , though , when he spoke German , and at such times he always waved his hand before his face as though trying to catch the lost word , and no one could induce him to go on speaking till he had found the missing word .
