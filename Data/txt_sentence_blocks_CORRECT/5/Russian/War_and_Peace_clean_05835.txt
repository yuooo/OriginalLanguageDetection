But how did that old man , alone , in opposition to the general opinion , so truly discern the importance of the people 's view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it ? 
The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength . 
Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner , contrary to the Tsar 's wish , to select him -- an old man in disfavor -- to be their representative in the national war . 
And only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he , the commander in chief , devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them . 
That simple , modest , and therefore truly great , figure could not be cast in the false mold of a European hero -- the supposed ruler of men -- that history has invented .
