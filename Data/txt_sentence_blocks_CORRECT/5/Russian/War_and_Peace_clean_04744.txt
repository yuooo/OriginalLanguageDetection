The hall porter was standing at the front door . 
From the landing where Pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance . 
He went down that staircase and out into the yard . 
No one had seen him . 
But there were some carriages waiting , and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him .
