This was Prince Bolkonski . 
Beside him was his comrade Nesvitski , a tall staff officer , extremely stout , with a kindly , smiling , handsome face and moist eyes . 
Nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him . 
This hussar , with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes , watched the regimental commander 's back and mimicked his every movement . 
Each time the commander started and bent forward , the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner .
