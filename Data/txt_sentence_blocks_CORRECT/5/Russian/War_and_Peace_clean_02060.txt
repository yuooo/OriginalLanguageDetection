The day after he had been received into the Lodge , Pierre was sitting at home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square , one side of which symbolized God , another moral things , a third physical things , and the fourth a combination of these . 
Now and then his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in imagination a new plan of life . 
On the previous evening at the Lodge , he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg . 
Pierre proposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs . 
He was joyfully planning this new life , when Prince Vasili suddenly entered the room .
