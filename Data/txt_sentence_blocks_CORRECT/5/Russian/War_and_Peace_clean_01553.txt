Miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the Emperor . 
The Apsheron men , excited by the Tsar 's presence , passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold , brisk pace . 
`` Lads ! '' 
shouted Miloradovich in a loud , self-confident , and cheery voice , obviously so elated by the sound of firing , by the prospect of battle , and by the sight of the gallant Apsherons , his comrades in Suvorov 's time , now passing so gallantly before the Emperors , that he forgot the sovereigns ' presence . 
`` Lads , it 's not the first village you 've had to take , '' cried he .
