Petya was as musical as Natasha and more so than Nicholas , but had never learned music or thought about it , and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive . 
The music became more and more audible . 
The melody grew and passed from one instrument to another . 
And what was played was a fugue -- though Petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is . 
Each instrument -- now resembling a violin and now a horn , but better and clearer than violin or horn - played its own part , and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air , and then with a third and a fourth ; and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended , now into solemn church music , now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant .
