In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily . 
They do not sting , but crawl away from danger . 
Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive , and they flew out empty ; now they fly out laden . 
The beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in . 
Instead of black , glossy bees -- tamed by toil , clinging to one another 's legs and drawing out the wax , with a ceaseless hum of labor - that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive , drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive .
