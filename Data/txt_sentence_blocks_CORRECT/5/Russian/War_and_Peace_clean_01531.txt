He looked now at the Pratzen Heights , now at the sun floating up out of the mist . 
When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog , and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light -- as if he had only awaited this to begin the action -- he drew the glove from his shapely white hand , made a sign with it to the marshals , and ordered the action to begin . 
The marshals , accompanied by adjutants , galloped off in different directions , and a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by Russian troops moving down the valley to their left . 
At eight o'clock Kutuzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth column , Miloradovich 's , the one that was to take the place of Przebyszewski 's and Langeron 's columns which had already gone down into the valley . 
He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march , thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself .
