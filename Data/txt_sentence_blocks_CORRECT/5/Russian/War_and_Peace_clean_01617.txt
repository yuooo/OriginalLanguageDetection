Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall . 
Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions , they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph , generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds , and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved . 
`` Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four o'clock and the battle is lost ? 
No , certainly I must not approach him , I must not intrude on his reflections . 
Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him , '' Rostov decided ; and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away , continually looking back at the Tsar , who still remained in the same attitude of indecision .
