Sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything , but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her . 
She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up . 
To sacrifice herself for others was Sonya 's habit . 
Her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth , and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it . 
But in all her former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others , and so made her more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world .
