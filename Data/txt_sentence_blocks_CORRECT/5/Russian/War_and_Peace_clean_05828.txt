These men , carried away by their passions , were but blind tools of the most melancholy law of necessity , but considered themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed . 
They blamed Kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon , that he thought nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen Factories because he was comfortable there , that at Krasnoe he checked the advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite lost his head , and that it was probable that he had an understanding with Napoleon and had been bribed by him , and so on , and so on . 
Not only did his contemporaries , carried away by their passions , talk in this way , but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand , while Kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty , dissolute , weak old courtier , and by Russians as something indefinite - a sort of puppet useful only because he had a Russian name . 
In 1812 and 1813 Kutuzov was openly accused of blundering . 
The Emperor was dissatisfied with him .
