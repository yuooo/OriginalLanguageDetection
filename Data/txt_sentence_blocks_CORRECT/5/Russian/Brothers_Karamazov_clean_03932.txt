Grigory 's wife , Marfa , in answer to Ivan 's questions , declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall , `` He was not three paces from our bed , '' and that although she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning , `` He was moaning the whole time , moaning continually . '' 
Talking to Herzenstube , and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was not mad , but only rather weak , Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle smile . 
`` Do you know how he spends his time now ? '' 
he asked ; `` learning lists of French words by heart . 
He has an exercise-book under his pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him by someone , he he he ! ''
