Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by nature . 
Oh , we shall persuade them at last not to be proud , for Thou didst lift them up and thereby taught them to be proud . 
We shall show them that they are weak , that they are only pitiful children , but that childlike happiness is the sweetest of all . 
They will become timid and will look to us and huddle close to us in fear , as chicks to the hen . 
They will marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us , and will be proud at our being so powerful and clever that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions .
