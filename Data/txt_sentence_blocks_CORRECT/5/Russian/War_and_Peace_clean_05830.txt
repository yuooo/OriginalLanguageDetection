For Russian historians , strange and terrible to say , Napoleon - that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere , even in exile , showed human dignity -- Napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm ; he is grand . 
But Kutuzov -- the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in 1812 , never once swerving by word or deed from Borodino to Vilna , presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happening -- Kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful , and when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little ashamed . 
And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim ; and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people . 
Still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all Kutuzov 's efforts were directed in 1812 . 
Kutuzov never talked of `` forty centuries looking down from the Pyramids , '' of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland , or of what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished ; in general he said nothing about himself , adopted no prose , always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of men , and said the simplest and most ordinary things .
