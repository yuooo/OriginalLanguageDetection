They are sinful and rebellious , but in the end they too will become obedient . 
They will marvel at us and look on us as gods , because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so dreadful and to rule over them - so awful it will seem to them to be free . 
But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in Thy name . 
We shall deceive them again , for we will not let Thee come to us again . 
That deception will be our suffering , for we shall be forced to lie . ''
