That evening the Rostovs went to the Opera , for which Marya Dmitrievna had taken a box . 
Natasha did not want to go , but could not refuse Marya Dmitrievna 's kind offer which was intended expressly for her . 
When she came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father , and looking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty , very pretty , she felt even more sad , but it was a sweet , tender sadness . 
`` O God , if he were here now I would not behave as I did then , but differently . 
I would not be silly and afraid of things , I would simply embrace him , cling to him , and make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me , and then I would make him laugh as he used to laugh .
