In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to Bald Hills . 
Prince Andrew , glancing at Pierre , broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper . 
Pointing to the fields , he spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry . 
Pierre remained gloomily silent , answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts . 
He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy , had gone astray , did not see the true light , and that he , Pierre , ought to aid , enlighten , and raise him .
