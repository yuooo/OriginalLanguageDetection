-LRB- 2 -RRB- The purification and reformation of oneself for its reception , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- The improvement of the human race by striving for such purification . 
Which is the principal aim of these three ? 
Certainly self-reformation and self-purification . 
Only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances . 
But at the same time just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us ; and so , led astray by pride , losing sight of this aim , we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive , or seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and profligacy .
