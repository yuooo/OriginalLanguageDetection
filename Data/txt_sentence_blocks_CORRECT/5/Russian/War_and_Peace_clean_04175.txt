On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozhaysk . 
At the descent of the high steep hill , down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right , where a service was being held and the bells were ringing , Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot . 
Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers . 
Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day before . 
The peasant drivers , shouting and lashing their horses , kept crossing from side to side .
