Everything not connected with the execution of the prince 's orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alpatych . 
On reaching Smolensk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up in the Gachina suburb across the Dnieper , at the inn kept by Ferapontov , where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years . 
Some thirty years ago Ferapontov , by Alpatych 's advice , had bought a wood from the prince , had begun to trade , and now had a house , an inn , and a corn dealer 's shop in that province . 
He was a stout , dark , red-faced peasant in the forties , with thick lips , a broad knob of a nose , similar knobs over his black frowning brows , and a round belly . 
Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt , Ferapontov was standing before his shop which opened onto the street .
