After his first visit Boris said to himself that Natasha attracted him just as much as ever , but that he must not yield to that feeling , because to marry her , a girl almost without fortune , would mean ruin to his career , while to renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable . 
Boris made up his mind to avoid meeting Natasha , but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the Rostovs ' . 
It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with Natasha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten , that in spite of everything ... she could not be his wife , that he had no means , and they would never let her marry him .
