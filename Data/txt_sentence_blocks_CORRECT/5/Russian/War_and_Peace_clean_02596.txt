Prince Andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies and listened to her . 
In the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him , a thing he had thought impossible for him . 
He looked at Natasha as she sang , and something new and joyful stirred in his soul . 
He felt happy and at the same time sad . 
He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep .
