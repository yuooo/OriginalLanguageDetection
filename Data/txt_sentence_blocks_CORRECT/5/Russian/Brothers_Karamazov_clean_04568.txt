Everyone looked at Mitya ; he sat silent through the whole of the prosecutor 's speech , clenching his teeth , with his hands clasped , and his head bowed . 
Only from time to time he raised his head and listened , especially when Grushenka was spoken of . 
When the prosecutor mentioned Rakitin 's opinion of her , a smile of contempt and anger passed over his face and he murmured rather audibly , `` The Bernards ! '' 
When Ippolit Kirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at Mokroe , Mitya raised his head and listened with intense curiosity . 
At one point he seemed about to jump up and cry out , but controlled himself and only shrugged his shoulders disdainfully .
