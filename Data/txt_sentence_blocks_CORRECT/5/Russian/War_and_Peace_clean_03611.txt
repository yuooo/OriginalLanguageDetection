Now he rode beside Ilyin under the birch trees , occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand , sometimes touching his horse 's side with his foot , or , without turning round , handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him , with as calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride . 
He glanced with pity at the excited face of Ilyin , who talked much and in great agitation . 
He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him . 
As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds , the wind fell , as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm ; drops still continued to fall , but vertically now , and all was still . 
The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it .
