`` Dear Countess , what an age ... She has been laid up , poor child ... at the Razumovski 's ball ... and Countess Apraksina ... I was so delighted ... '' came the sounds of animated feminine voices , interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs . 
Then one of those conversations began which last out until , at the first pause , the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say , `` I am so delighted ... Mamma 's health ... and Countess Apraksina ... '' and then , again rustling , pass into the anteroom , put on cloaks or mantles , and drive away . 
The conversation was on the chief topic of the day : the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine 's day , Count Bezukhov , and about his illegitimate son Pierre , the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pavlovna 's reception . 
`` I am so sorry for the poor count , '' said the visitor . 
`` He is in such bad health , and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him ! ''
