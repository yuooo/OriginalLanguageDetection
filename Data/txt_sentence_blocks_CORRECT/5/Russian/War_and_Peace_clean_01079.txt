The French columns that had advanced beyond the village went back ; but as though in revenge for this failure , the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at Tushin 's battery . 
In their childlike glee , aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the French , our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls , and then four more , fell among our guns , one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon driver 's leg . 
Their spirits once roused were , however , not diminished , but only changed character . 
The horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage , the wounded were carried away , and the four guns were turned against the ten-gun battery . 
Tushin 's companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns ' crews had been disabled , but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever .
