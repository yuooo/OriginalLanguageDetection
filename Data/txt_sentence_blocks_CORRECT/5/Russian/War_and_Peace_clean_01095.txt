As soon as Tushin with his guns , continually driving round or coming upon wounded men , was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip , he was met by some of the staff , among them the staff officer and Zherkov , who had been twice sent to Tushin 's battery but had never reached it . 
Interrupting one another , they all gave , and transmitted , orders as to how to proceed , reprimanding and reproaching him . 
Tushin gave no orders , and , silently -- fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why -- rode behind on his artillery nag . 
Though the orders were to abandon the wounded , many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages . 
The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Tushin 's wattle shed was laid , with a bullet in his stomach , on `` Matvevna 's '' carriage .
