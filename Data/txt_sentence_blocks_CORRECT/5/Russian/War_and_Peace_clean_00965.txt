But a freak of fate made the impossible possible . 
The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutuzov in a similar way . 
Meeting Bagration 's weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutuzov 's whole army . 
To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna , and with this object offered a three days ' truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving . 
Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding , and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed .
