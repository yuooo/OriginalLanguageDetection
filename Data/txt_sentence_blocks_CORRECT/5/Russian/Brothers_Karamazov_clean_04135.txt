If anything is wrong with your nose , they send you to Paris : there , they say , is a European specialist who cures noses . 
If you go to Paris , he 'll look at your nose ; I can only cure your right nostril , he 'll tell you , for I do n't cure the left nostril , that 's not my speciality , but go to Vienna , there there 's a specialist who will cure your left nostril . 
What are you to do ? 
I fell back on popular remedies , a German doctor advised me to rub myself with honey and salt in the bath-house . 
Solely to get an extra bath I went , smeared myself all over and it did me no good at all .
