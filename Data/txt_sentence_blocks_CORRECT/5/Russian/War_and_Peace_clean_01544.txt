When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kutuzov was standing began to shout , he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown . 
Along the road from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms . 
Two of them rode side by side in front , at full gallop . 
One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse , the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one . 
These were the two Emperors followed by their suites .
