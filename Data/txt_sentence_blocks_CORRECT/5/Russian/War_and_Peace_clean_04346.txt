It was the same panorama he had admired from that spot the day before , but now the whole place was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns , and the slanting rays of the bright sun , rising slightly to the left behind Pierre , cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy , golden tinted light and long dark shadows . 
The forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green color ; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Valuevo by the Smolensk highroad crowded with troops . 
Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses . 
There were troops to be seen everywhere , in front and to the right and left . 
All this was vivid , majestic , and unexpected ; but what impressed Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself , of Borodino and the hollows on both sides of the Kolocha .
