For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other can worship , but to find community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time . 
For the sake of common worship they 've slain each other with the sword . 
They have set up gods and challenged one another , `` Put away your gods and come and worship ours , or we will kill you and your gods ! '' 
And so it will be to the end of the world , even when gods disappear from the earth ; they will fall down before idols just the same . 
Thou didst know , Thou couldst not but have known , this fundamental secret of human nature , but Thou didst reject the one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow down to Thee alone - the banner of earthly bread ; and Thou hast rejected it for the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven .
