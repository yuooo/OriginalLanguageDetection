The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky 1879 The History of a Family Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov ALEXEY Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov , a landowner well known in our district in his own day , and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death , which happened thirteen years ago , and which I shall describe in its proper place . 
For the present I will only say that this `` landowner '' - for so we used to call him , although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate - was a strange type , yet one pretty frequently to be met with , a type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless . 
But he was one of those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their worldly affairs , and , apparently , after nothing else . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch , for instance , began with next to nothing ; his estate was of the smallest ; he ran to dine at other men 's tables , and fastened on them as a toady , yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard cash . 
At the same time , he was all his life one of the most senseless , fantastical fellows in the whole district .
