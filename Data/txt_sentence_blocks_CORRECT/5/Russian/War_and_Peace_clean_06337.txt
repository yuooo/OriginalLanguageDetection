To these questions three answers are possible : Either to assume -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen , and that therefore every emergence of a new power , every struggle against the power once appointed , should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power ; or -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally , under definite and known conditions , and to show that all limitations , conflicts , and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them ; or -LRB- 3 -RRB- that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally , but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite , and that the appearance of several authorities , their struggles and their falls , result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others . 
And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers . 
Some historians -- those biographical and specialist historians already referred to -- in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power , seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons , and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power , and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power -- mere violence . 
Their theory , suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history , has the inconvenience -- in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another -- that a Legitimist historian will prove that the National Convention , the Directory , and Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power , while a Republican and a Bonapartist will prove : the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the real power , and that all the others were violations of power . 
Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children .
