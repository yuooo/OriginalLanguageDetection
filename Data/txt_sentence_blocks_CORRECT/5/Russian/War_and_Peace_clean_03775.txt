Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas , watching his lessons , teaching him Russian and music herself , and talking to Dessalles ; the rest of the day she spent over her books , with her old nurse , or with `` God 's folk '' who sometimes came by the back door to see her .

`` I write you in Russian , my good friend , '' wrote Julie in her Frenchified Russian , `` because I have a detestation for all the French , and the same for their language which I can not support to hear spoken ... .
