The officer searched till six o'clock in the evening without even stopping to eat . 
Ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was . 
The officer snatched a little food at a comrade 's , and rode again to the vanguard to find Miloradovich . 
Miloradovich too was away , but here he was told that he had gone to a ball at General Kikin 's and that Ermolov was probably there too . 
`` But where is it ? ''
