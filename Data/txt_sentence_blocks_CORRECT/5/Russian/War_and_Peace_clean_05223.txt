Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well . 
Here and there he could see churches that had not been burned . 
The Kremlin , which was not destroyed , gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of Ivan the Great . 
The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly . 
These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin .
