It was an autumn night , so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole . 
Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch . 
The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows . 
The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall , waiting to bid good-by to the young prince . 
The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall : Michael Ivanovich , Mademoiselle Bourienne , Princess Mary , and the little princess .
