The startling , incredibly supercilious tone of this man who had once been his valet , was extraordinary in itself . 
He had not taken such a tone even at their last interview . 
`` I tell you , you 've nothing to be afraid of . 
I wo n't say anything about you ; there 's no proof against you . 
I say , how your hands are trembling !
