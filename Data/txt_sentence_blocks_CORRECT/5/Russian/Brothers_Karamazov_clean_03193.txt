`` I have told you I am yours , and I will be yours . 
I will follow you for ever , wherever they may send you . 
Farewell ; you are guiltless , though you 've been your own undoing . '' 
Her lips quivered , tears flowed from her eyes . 
`` Forgive me , Grusha , for my love , for ruining you , too , with my love . ''
