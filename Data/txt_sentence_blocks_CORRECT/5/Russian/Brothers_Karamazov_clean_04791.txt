The doctors shall make me some sort of wart on my face - what 's the use of their being so mechanical ! 
- or else I 'll put out one eye , let my beard grow a yard , and I shall turn grey , fretting for Russia . 
I dare say they wo n't recognise us . 
And if they do , let them send us to Siberia - I do n't care . 
It will show it 's our fate .
