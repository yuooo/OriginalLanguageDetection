It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a dispute , but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and delight would find in his wife 's ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued , but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion . 
After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man , and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife . 
He felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping . 
But only what was really good in him was reflected in his wife , all that was not quite good was rejected . 
And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection .
