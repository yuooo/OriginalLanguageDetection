It was his habit to send the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone . 
The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there , although there was a kitchen in the house ; he did not like the smell of cooking , and , winter and summer alike , the dishes were carried in across the courtyard . 
The house was built for a large family ; there was room for five times as many , with their servants . 
But at the time of our story there was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son Ivan .
