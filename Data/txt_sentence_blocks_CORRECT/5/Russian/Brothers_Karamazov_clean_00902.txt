`` You know , Alexey Fyodorovitch , we 're fanciful , we 're self-willed , but proudest of the proud in our little heart . 
We 're noble , we 're generous , Alexey Fyodorovitch , let me tell you . 
We have only been unfortunate . 
We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy , perhaps , or fickle man . 
There was one man - one , an officer too , we loved him , we sacrificed everything to him .
