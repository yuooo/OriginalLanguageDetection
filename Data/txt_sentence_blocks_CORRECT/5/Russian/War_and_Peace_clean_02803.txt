Daniel rose a little , took a step , and with his whole weight , as if lying down to rest , fell on the wolf , seizing her by the ears . 
Nicholas was about to stab her , but Daniel whispered , `` Do n't ! 
We 'll gag her ! '' 
and , changing his position , set his foot on the wolf 's neck . 
A stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash , as if bridled , her legs were bound together , and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side .
