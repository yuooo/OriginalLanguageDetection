These dispositions , which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius , related to Napoleon 's orders to deal with four points -- four different orders . 
Not one of these was , or could be , carried out . 
In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by Napoleon , with the guns of Pernetti and Fouche ; which were to come in line with them , 102 guns in all , were to open fire and shower shells on the Russian fleches and redoubts . 
This could not be done , as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the Russian works , and those 102 guns shot into the air until the nearest commander , contrary to Napoleon 's instructions , moved them forward . 
The second order was that Poniatowski , moving to the village through the wood , should turn the Russian left flank .
