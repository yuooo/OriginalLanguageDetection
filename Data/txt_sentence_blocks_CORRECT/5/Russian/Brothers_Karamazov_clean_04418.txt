There , again , he squandered the money he had stolen after the murder of his father . 
And a day before the murder he wrote me this letter . 
He was drunk when he wrote it . 
I saw it at once , at the time . 
He wrote it from spite , and feeling certain , positively certain , that I should never show it to anyone , even if he did kill him , or else he would n't have written it .
