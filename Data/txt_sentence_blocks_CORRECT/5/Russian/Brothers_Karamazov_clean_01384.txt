The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha 's mind with every hour . 
What that catastrophe was , and what he would say at that moment to his brother , he could perhaps not have said definitely . 
`` Even if my benefactor must die without me , anyway I wo n't have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not , but passed by and hastened home . 
If I do as I intend , I shall be following his great precept . '' 
His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares , to climb over the fence , as he had the day before , get into the garden and sit in the summer-house .
