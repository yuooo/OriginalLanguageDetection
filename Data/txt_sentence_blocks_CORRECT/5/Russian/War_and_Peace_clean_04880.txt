Planning beforehand what he would say to Kutuzov , Rostopchin turned angrily in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to side . 
The Sokolniki field was deserted . 
Only at the end of it , in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum , could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating . 
One of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchin 's carriage , and the count himself , his coachman , and his dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them . 
Swaying from side to side on his long , thin legs in his fluttering dressing gown , this lunatic was running impetuously , his gaze fixed on Rostopchin , shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him to stop .
