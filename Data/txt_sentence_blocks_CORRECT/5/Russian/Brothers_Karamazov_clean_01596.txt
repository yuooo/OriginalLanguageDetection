Thou didst Thyself lift up that banner . 
But with us all will be happy and will no more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom . 
Oh , we shall persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to us . 
And shall we be right or shall we be lying ? 
They will be convinced that we are right , for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them .
