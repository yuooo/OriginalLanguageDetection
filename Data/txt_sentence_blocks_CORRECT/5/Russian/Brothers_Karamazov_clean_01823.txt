`` That 's what 's so strange , '' I said . 
`` For I ought to have owned my fault as soon as I got here , before he had fired a shot , before leading him into a great and deadly sin ; but we have made our life so grotesque , that to act in that way would have been almost impossible , for only after I had faced his shot at the distance of twelve paces could my words have any significance for him , and if I had spoken before , he would have said , ` He is a coward , the sight of the pistols has frightened him , no use to listen to him . ' 
Gentlemen , '' I cried suddenly , speaking straight from my heart , `` look around you at the gifts of God , the clear sky , the pure air , the tender grass , the birds ; nature is beautiful and sinless , and we , only we , are sinful and foolish , and we do n't understand that life is heaven , for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty , we shall embrace each other and weep . '' 
I would have said more but I could not ; my voice broke with the sweetness and youthful gladness of it , and there was such bliss in my heart as I had never known before in my life . 
`` All this is rational and edifying , '' said my antagonist , `` and in any case you are an original person . ''
