` I 'll pay him out , I 'll pay him out ! 
That 's what I used to cry out in the dark . 
And when I suddenly thought that I should really do nothing to him , and that he was laughing at me then , or perhaps had utterly forgotten me , I would fling myself on the floor , melt into helpless tears , and lie there shaking till dawn . 
In the morning I would get up more spiteful than a dog , ready to tear the whole world to pieces . 
And then what do you think ?
