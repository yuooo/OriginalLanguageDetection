A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration . 
In the middle of the street stood a French general saying something to those around him . 
Pierre , accompanied by the maid , was advancing to the spot where the general stood , but the French soldiers stopped him . 
`` On ne passe pas ! '' 
* cried a voice .
