The Rostov party spent the night at Mytishchi , fourteen miles from Moscow . 
They had started so late on the first of September , the road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops , so many things had been forgotten for which servants were sent back , that they had decided to spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow . 
The next morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far as Great Mytishchi . 
At ten o'clock that evening the Rostov family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village . 
The Rostovs ' servants and coachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers , after attending to their masters , had supper , fed the horses , and came out into the porches .
