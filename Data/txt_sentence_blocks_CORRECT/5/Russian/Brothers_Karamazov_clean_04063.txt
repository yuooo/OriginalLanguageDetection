I went back to my bed , lay down and thought , ` If Grigory Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me , but if he is not killed and recovers , it will be first-rate , for then he 'll bear witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here , and so he must have killed him and taken the money . ' 
Then I began groaning with suspense and impatience , so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible . 
At last she got up and she rushed to me , but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch was not there , she ran out , and I heard her scream in the garden . 
And that set it all going and set my mind at rest . '' 
He stopped .
