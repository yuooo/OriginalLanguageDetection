he inquired . 
And as he spoke he saw a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons . 
He had a long thin neck , and his head , that had been half shaved , was again covered by short hair . 
This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur , that had once been smart , and dirty hempen convict trousers , over which were pulled his thin , dirty , trodden-down boots .
