Prince Andrew seemed , and really was , quite a different , quite a new man . 
Where was his spleen , his contempt for life , his disillusionment ? 
Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly ; and to him he told all that was in his soul . 
Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future , said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father 's caprice , and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her , or would do without his consent ; then he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange , apart from and independent of himself . 
`` I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of such love , '' said Prince Andrew .
