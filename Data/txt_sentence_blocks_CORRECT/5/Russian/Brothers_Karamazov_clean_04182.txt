Somebody takes all the credit of what 's good for Himself , and nothing but nastiness is left for me . 
But I do n't envy the honour of a life of idle imposture , I am not ambitious . 
Why am I , of all creatures in the world , doomed to be cursed by all decent people and even to be kicked , for if I put on mortal form I am bound to take such consequences sometimes ? 
I know , of course , there 's a secret in it , but they wo n't tell me the secret for anything , for then perhaps , seeing the meaning of it , I might bawl hosannah , and the indispensable minus would disappear at once , and good sense would reign supreme throughout the whole world . 
And that , of course , would mean the end of everything , even of magazines and newspapers , for who would take them in ?
