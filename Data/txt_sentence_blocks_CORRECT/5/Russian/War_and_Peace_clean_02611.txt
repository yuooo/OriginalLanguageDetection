Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself , and Berg and Vera immediately began their evening party , interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their guest . 
Vera , having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be entertained with conversation about the French embassy , at once began accordingly . 
Berg , having decided that masculine conversation was required , interrupted his wife 's remarks and touched on the question of the war with Austria , and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them . 
Though the conversation was very incoherent and Vera was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element , both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that , even if only one guest was present , their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its talk , tea , and lighted candles . 
Before long Boris , Berg 's old comrade , arrived .
