` I 'd be delighted to have my nose pulled every day of my life , if it were only in its proper place . ' 
` My son , ' sighs the priest , ` you ca n't expect every blessing at once . 
This is murmuring against Providence , who even in this has not forgotten you , for if you repine as you repined just now , declaring you 'd be glad to have your nose pulled for the rest of your life , your desire has already been fulfilled indirectly , for when you lost your nose , you were led by the nose . ' 
`` Fool , how stupid ! '' 
cried Ivan .
