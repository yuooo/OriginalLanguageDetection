Prince Bagration ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank . 
The officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away , the guns would remain without support . 
Prince Bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence . 
It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer 's remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it . 
But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers .
