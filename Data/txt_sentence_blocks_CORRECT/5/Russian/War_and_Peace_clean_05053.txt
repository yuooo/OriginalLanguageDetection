Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head , Pierre went down the corridor , trying to avoid making a noise or meeting the captain , and passed out into the street . 
The conflagration , at which he had looked with so much indifference the evening before , had greatly increased during the night . 
Moscow was on fire in several places . 
The buildings in Carriage Row , across the river , in the Bazaar and the Povarskoy , as well as the barges on the Moskva River and the timber yards by the Dorogomilov Bridge , were all ablaze . 
Pierre 's way led through side streets to the Povarskoy and from there to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbat , where he had long before decided that the deed should should be done .
