While Rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away , Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot , and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him , offered his services , and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot . 
The Emperor , wishing to rest and feeling unwell , sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him . 
Rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor , evidently weeping , covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll 's hand . 
`` And I might have been in his place ! '' 
thought Rostov , and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor , he rode on in utter despair , not knowing where to or why he was now riding .
