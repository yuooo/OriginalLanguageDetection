Nicholas noticed this , as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary 's character with an observation unusual to him , and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being . 
Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess -LRB- as she did when he was mentioned -RRB- and even when he thought of her , but in her presence he felt quite at ease , and said not at all what he had prepared , but what , quite appropriately , occurred to him at the moment . 
When a pause occurred during his short visit , Nicholas , as is usual when there are children , turned to Prince Andrew 's little son , caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar . 
He took the boy on his knee , played with him , and looked round at Princess Mary . 
With a softened , happy , timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved .
