It 's absurd to ask . 
Because I had condemned myself to die at five o'clock this morning , here , at dawn . 
I thought it made no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honour . 
But I see it 's not so , it turns out that it does make a difference . 
Believe me , gentlemen , what has tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I 'd killed the old servant , and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded , and Heaven was open to me again .
