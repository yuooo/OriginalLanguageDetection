To make quite sure of the firmness the ground , he put his other foot down and sank deeper still , became stuck in it , and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog . 
Joseph Alexeevich was not in Petersburg -- he had of late stood aside from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges , and lived almost entirely in Moscow .
