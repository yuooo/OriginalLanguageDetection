I soothed and calmed her . 
I impressed on her that you have to clear yourself , so she must n't hinder you , must not depress you , or you may lose your head and say the wrong thing in your evidence . 
In fact , I talked to her and she understood . 
She 's a sensible girl , my boy , a good-hearted girl , she would have kissed my old hands , begging help for you . 
She sent me herself , to tell you not to worry about her .
