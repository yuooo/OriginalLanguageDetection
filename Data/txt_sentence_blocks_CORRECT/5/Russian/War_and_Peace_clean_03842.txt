The evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with smoke , through which , high up , the sickle of the new moon shone strangely . 
Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town , broken only by the rustle of footsteps , the moaning , the distant cries , and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere . 
The cook 's moans had now subsided . 
On two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires . 
Through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill .
