In dealing with humanity 's inquiry , the science of history up to now is like money in circulation -- paper money and coin . 
The biographies and special national histories are like paper money . 
They can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously , as long as no one asks what is the security behind them . 
You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events , and such histories as Thiers ' will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry . 
But just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because , being easy to make , too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold , so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires : by what force did Napoleon do this ?
