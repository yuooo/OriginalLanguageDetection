Their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part harmful -LRB- the harm was scarcely perceptible , as they were given in small doses -RRB- , but they were useful , necessary , and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who loved her -- and that is why there are , and always will be , pseudo-healers , wise women , homeopaths , and allopaths . 
They satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief , for sympathy , and that something should be done , which is felt by those who are suffering . 
They satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child , when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt . 
A child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed , and it feels better when this is done . 
The child can not believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain , and the hope of relief and the expression of its mother 's sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it .
