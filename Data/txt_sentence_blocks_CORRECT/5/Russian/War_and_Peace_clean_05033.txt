His mind was not in a normal state . 
A healthy man usually thinks of , feels , and remembers innumerable things simultaneously , but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention . 
A healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts . 
But Prince Andrew 's mind was not in a normal state in that respect . 
All the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever , but they acted apart from his will .
