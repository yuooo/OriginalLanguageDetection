But hesitation , suspense , conflict between belief and disbelief - is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man , such as you are , that it 's better to hang oneself at once . 
Knowing that you are inclined to believe in me , I administered some disbelief by telling you that anecdote . 
I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns , and I have my motive in it . 
It 's the new method . 
As soon as you disbelieve in me completely , you 'll begin assuring me to my face that I am not a dream but a reality .
