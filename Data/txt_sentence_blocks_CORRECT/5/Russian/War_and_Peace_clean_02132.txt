Everywhere were receptions , which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart . 
In one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul , asking permission , as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them , to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul , his patron saints . 
In another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work . 
On a third estate the priest , bearing a cross , came to meet him surrounded by children whom , by the count 's generosity , he was instructing in reading , writing , and religion . 
On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection , all on one plan , for hospitals , schools , and almshouses , which were soon to be opened .
