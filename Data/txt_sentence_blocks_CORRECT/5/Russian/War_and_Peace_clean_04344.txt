Outside all was bright , fresh , dewy , and cheerful . 
The sun , just bursting forth from behind a cloud that had concealed it , was shining , with rays still half broken by the clouds , over the roofs of the street opposite , on the dew-besprinkled dust of the road , on the walls of the houses , on the windows , the fence , and on Pierre 's horses standing before the hut . 
The roar of guns sounded more distinct outside . 
An adjutant accompanied by a Cossack passed by at a sharp trot . 
`` It 's time , Count ; it 's time ! ''
