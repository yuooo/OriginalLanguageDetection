Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below . 
Let us try to conform to them and follow them , and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam , the better we shall please God , who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him ; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us , the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit . 
My father has not spoken to me of a suitor , but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasili . 
In regard to this project of marriage for me , I will tell you , dear sweet friend , that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform . 
However painful it may be to me , should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can , without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husband .
