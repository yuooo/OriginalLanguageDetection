We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors , the law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty churches -- but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness , a priest , gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution . '' 
So thought Pierre , and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts , accustomed as he was to it , astonished him each time as if it were something new . 
`` I understand the deception and confusion , '' he thought , `` but how am I to tell them all that I see ? 
I have tried , and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as I do , and only try not to see it . 
So it appears that it must be so !
