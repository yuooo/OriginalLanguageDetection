A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball . 
The ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter . 
Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick , the allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon , as it had done to all who had seen it in Paris , quite clear and very pleasing . 
`` The King of Rome ! '' 
he said , pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture .
