Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war . 
When he saw Mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost , understood all the difficulties of the Russian army 's position , and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play . 
Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week 's time he might , perhaps , see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the French since Suvorov met them . 
He feared that Bonaparte 's genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops , and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced . 
Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his room to write to his father , to whom he wrote every day .
