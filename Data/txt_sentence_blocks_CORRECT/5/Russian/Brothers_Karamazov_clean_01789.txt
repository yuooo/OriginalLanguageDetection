Let him open that book and begin reading it without grand words or superciliousness , without condescension to them , but gently and kindly , being glad that he is reading to them and that they are listening with attention , loving the words himself , only stopping from time to time to explain words that are not understood by the peasants . 
Do n't be anxious , they will understand everything , the orthodox heart will understand all ! 
Let him read them about Abraham and Sarah , about Isaac and Rebecca , of how Jacob went to Laban and wrestled with the Lord in his dream and said , `` This place is holy '' - and he will impress the devout mind of the peasant . 
Let him read , especially to the children , how the brothers sold Joseph , the tender boy , the dreamer and prophet , into bondage , and told their father that a wild beast had devoured him , and showed him his blood-stained clothes . 
Let him read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed into Egypt for corn , and Joseph , already a great ruler , unrecognised by them , tormented them , accused them , kept his brother Benjamin , and all through love : `` I love you , and loving you I torment you . ''
