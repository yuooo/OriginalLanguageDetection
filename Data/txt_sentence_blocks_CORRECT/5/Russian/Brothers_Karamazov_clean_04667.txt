I should not have laughed at that in his place . 
Yes , such natures - oh , let me speak in defence of such natures , so often and so cruelly misunderstood - these natures often thirst for tenderness , goodness , and justice , as it were , in contrast to themselves , their unruliness , their ferocity - they thirst for it unconsciously . 
Passionate and fierce on the surface , they are painfully capable of loving woman , for instance , and with a spiritual and elevated love . 
Again do not laugh at me , this is very often the case in such natures . 
But they can not hide their passions - sometimes very coarse - and that is conspicuous and is noticed , but the inner man is unseen .
