Strive to love your neighbour actively and indefatigably . 
In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul . 
If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbour , then you will believe without doubt , and no doubt can possibly enter your soul . 
This has been tried . 
This is certain . ''
