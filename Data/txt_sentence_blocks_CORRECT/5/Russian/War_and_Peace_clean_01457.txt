`` It is not true ; there are now two Russians , Miloradovich , and Dokhturov , and there would be a third , Count Arakcheev , if his nerves were not too weak . '' 
`` However , I think General Kutuzov has come out , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` I wish you good luck and success , gentlemen ! '' 
he added and went out after shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin . 
On the way home , Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutuzov , who was sitting silently beside him , what he thought of tomorrow 's battle .
