In the center Tushin 's forgotten battery , which had managed to set fire to the Schon Grabern village , delayed the French advance . 
The French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading , and thus gave us time to retreat . 
The retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy , but the different companies did not get mixed . 
But our left -- which consisted of the Azov and Podolsk infantry and the Pavlograd hussars -- was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion . 
Bagration had sent Zherkov to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately .
