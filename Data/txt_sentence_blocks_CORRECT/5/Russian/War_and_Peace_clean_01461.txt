Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and , availing himself of permission previously given him by Kutuzov to be present at the council , he remained in the room . 
`` Since Prince Bagration is not coming , we may begin , '' said Weyrother , hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of Brunn was spread out .
