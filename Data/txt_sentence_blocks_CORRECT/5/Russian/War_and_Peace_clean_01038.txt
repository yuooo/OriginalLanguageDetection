A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagration as he shouted , with an expression that seemed to say : `` We know that ourselves ! '' 
Another , without looking round , as though fearing to relax , shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on . 
The order was given to halt and down knapsacks . 
Bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted . 
He gave the reins to a Cossack , took off and handed over his felt coat , stretched his legs , and set his cap straight .
