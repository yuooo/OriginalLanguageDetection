It is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation -- as criticism has every right to do , seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be arbitrarily selected . 
Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation -LRB- the differential of history , that is , the individual tendencies of men -RRB- and attaining to the art of integrating them -LRB- that is , finding the sum of these infinitesimals -RRB- can we hope to arrive at the laws of history . 
The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people . 
Men leave their customary pursuits , hasten from one side of Europe to the other , plunder and slaughter one another , triumph and are plunged in despair , and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens . 
What was the cause of this movement , by what laws was it governed ?
