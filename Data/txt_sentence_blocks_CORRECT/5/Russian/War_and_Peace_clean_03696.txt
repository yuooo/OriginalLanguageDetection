The countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto . 
In all these words she saw only that the danger threatening her son would not soon be over . 
Shinshin , with a sarcastic smile on his lips , was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity : Sonya 's reading , any remark of the count 's , or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself . 
After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia , the hopes the Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility , Sonya , with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was being paid to her , read the last words : `` We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital and in others parts of our realm for consultation , and for the direction of all our levies , both those now barring the enemy 's path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear . 
May the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head , and may Europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of Russia ! ''
