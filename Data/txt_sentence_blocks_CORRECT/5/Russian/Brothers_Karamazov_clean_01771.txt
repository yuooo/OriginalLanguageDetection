The windows of his room looked out into the garden , and our garden was a shady one , with old trees in it which were coming into bud . 
The first birds of spring were flitting in the branches , chirruping and singing at the windows . 
And looking at them and admiring them , he began suddenly begging their forgiveness too : `` Birds of heaven , happy birds , forgive me , for I have sinned against you too . '' 
None of us could understand that at the time , but he shed tears of joy . 
`` Yes , '' he said , `` there was such a glory of God all about me : birds , trees , meadows , sky ; only I lived in shame and dishonoured it all and did not notice the beauty and glory . ''
