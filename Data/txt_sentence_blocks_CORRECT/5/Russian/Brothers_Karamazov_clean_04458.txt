Another personage closely connected with the case died here by his own hand last night . 
I mean an afflicted idiot , formerly the servant , and possibly the illegitimate son , of Fyodor Pavlovitch , Smerdyakov . 
At the preliminary inquiry , he told me with hysterical tears how the young Ivan Karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity . 
` Everything in the world is lawful according to him , and nothing must be forbidden in the future - that is what he always taught me . ' 
I believe that idiot was driven out of his mind by this theory , though , of course , the epileptic attacks from which he suffered , and this terrible catastrophe , have helped to unhinge his faculties .
