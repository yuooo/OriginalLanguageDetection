I know something about them , anyway . 
But try acknowledging you are in fault to a woman . 
Say , ' I am sorry , forgive me , ' and a shower of reproaches will follow ! 
Nothing will make her forgive you simply and directly , she 'll humble you to the dust , bring forward things that have never happened , recall everything , forget nothing , add something of her own , and only then forgive you . 
And even the best , the best of them do it .
