They were our Uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack . 
Rostov got out of their way , involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding , and galloped on . 
`` That is no business of mine , '' he thought . 
He had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left , across the whole width of the field , an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms , mounted on black horses , trotting straight toward him and across his path . 
Rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men , and he would have got clear had they continued at the same speed , but they kept increasing their pace , so that some of the horses were already galloping .
