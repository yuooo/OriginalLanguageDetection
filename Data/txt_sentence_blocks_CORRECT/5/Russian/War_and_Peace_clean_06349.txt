Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person ? 
On condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people . 
That is , power is power : in other words , power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand . 
If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning , then having subjected to criticism the explanation of `` power '' that juridical science gives us , humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence . 
But to understand phenomena man has , besides abstract reasoning , experience by which he verifies his reflections .
