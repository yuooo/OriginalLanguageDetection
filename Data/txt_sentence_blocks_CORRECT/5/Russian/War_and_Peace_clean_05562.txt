The French , retreating in 1812 -- though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves - congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the army together . 
The Russians , on the contrary , ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass , but in fact they split up into small units , because their spirit had so risen that separate individuals , without orders , dealt blows at the French without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers . 
The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into Smolensk . 
Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government , thousands of enemy stragglers , marauders , and foragers had been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants , who killed them off as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death . 
Denis Davydov , with his Russian instinct , was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the French , and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare .
