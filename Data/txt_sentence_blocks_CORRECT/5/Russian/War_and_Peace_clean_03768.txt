For God 's sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment . 
I can not stand it here . 
Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian can not exist and there is no sense in anything . 
I thought I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland , but it turns out that I am serving Barclay . 
I confess I do not want to . ''
