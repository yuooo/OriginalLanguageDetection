Natasha without knowing it was all attention : she did not lose a word , no single quiver in Pierre 's voice , no look , no twitch of a muscle in his face , nor a single gesture . 
She caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart , divining the secret meaning of all Pierre 's mental travail . 
Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him , but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention . 
She saw the possibility of love and happiness between Natasha and Pierre , and the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness . 
It was three o'clock in the morning .
