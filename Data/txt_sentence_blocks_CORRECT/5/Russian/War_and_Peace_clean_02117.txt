But as it turns out , just at that moment a third enemy rises before us - namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers , loudly demanding bread , meat , biscuits , fodder , and whatnot ! 
The stores are empty , the roads impassable . 
The Orthodox begin looting , and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea . 
Half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword . 
The inhabitants are totally ruined , the hospitals overflow with sick , and famine is everywhere .
