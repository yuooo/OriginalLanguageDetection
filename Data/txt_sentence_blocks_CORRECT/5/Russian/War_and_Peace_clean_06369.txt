Electricity produces heat , heat produces electricity . 
Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another . 
Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms , we can not say why this occurs , and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise , because it must be so and that it is a law . 
The same applies to historical events . 
Why war and revolution occur we do not know .
