The members and guests of the Club wandered hither and thither , sat , stood , met , and separated , some in uniform and some in evening dress , and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftans . 
Powdered footmen , in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings , stood at every door anxiously noting visitors ' every movement in order to offer their services . 
Most of those present were elderly , respected men with broad , self-confident faces , fat fingers , and resolute gestures and voices . 
This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups . 
A minority of those present were casual guests -- chiefly young men , among whom were Denisov , Rostov , and Dolokhov -- who was now again an officer in the Semenov regiment .
