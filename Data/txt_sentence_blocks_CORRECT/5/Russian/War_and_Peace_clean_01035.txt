Before they had reached Bagration , the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard . 
On their left flank , nearest to Bagration , marched a company commander , a fine round-faced man , with a stupid and happy expression -- the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed . 
At that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander . 
With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade , he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along , stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort , his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him . 
He carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword -LRB- small , curved , and not like a real weapon -RRB- and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step , his whole powerful body turning flexibly .
