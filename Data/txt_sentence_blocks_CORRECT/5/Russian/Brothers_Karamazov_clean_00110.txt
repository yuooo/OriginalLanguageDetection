Among the humbler people were a few of higher rank - two or three ladies and a very old general . 
They were all staying at the hotel . 
Our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars , but none of them gave them anything , except young Kalganov , who took a ten-copeck piece out of his purse , and , nervous and embarrassed - God knows why ! 
- hurriedly gave it to an old woman , saying : `` Divide it equally . '' 
None of his companions made any remark upon it , so that he had no reason to be embarrassed ; but , perceiving this , he was even more overcome .
