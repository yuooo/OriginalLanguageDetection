A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone-built Kremlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above their head . 
Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air , cawing and noisily flapping their wings . 
Together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant 's coat . 
He grasped a musket and took aim at the French . 
`` Fire ! ''
