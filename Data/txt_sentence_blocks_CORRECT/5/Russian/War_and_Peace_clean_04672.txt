On waking up that morning Count Ilya Rostov left his bedroom softly , so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning , and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown . 
In the yard stood the carts ready corded . 
The carriages were at the front porch . 
The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm . 
On seeing the count the major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away .
