Moscow seen from the Poklonny Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river , her gardens , and her churches , and she seemed to be living her usual life , her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight . 
The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture , such as he had never seen before , filled Napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them . 
This city was evidently living with the full force of its own life . 
By the indefinite signs which , even at a distance , distinguish a living body from a dead one , Napoleon from the Poklonny Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt , as it were , the breathing of that great and beautiful body . 
Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother ; every foreigner who sees her , even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city , must feel her feminine character , and Napoleon felt it .
