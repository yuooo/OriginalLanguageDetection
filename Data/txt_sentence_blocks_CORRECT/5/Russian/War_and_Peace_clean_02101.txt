Though he is a German -- I congratulate him ! 
I ca n't make out what the commander at Korchevo -- a certain Khandrikov -- is up to ; till now the additional men and provisions have not arrived . 
Gallop off to him at once and say I 'll have his head off if everything is not here in a week . 
Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from Petenka -- he took part in it -- and it 's all true . 
When mischief-makers do n't meddle even a German beats Buonaparte .
