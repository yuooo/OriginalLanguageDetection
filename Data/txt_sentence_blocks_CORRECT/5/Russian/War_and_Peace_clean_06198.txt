Pierre 's past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 -LRB- of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard -RRB- , his adventures in Moscow , his captivity , Platon Karataev -LRB- of whom he had heard from Pierre -RRB- , his love for Natasha -LRB- of whom the lad was also particularly fond -RRB- , and especially Pierre 's friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember -- all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint . 
From broken remarks about Natasha and his father , from the emotion with which Pierre spoke of that dead father , and from the careful , reverent tenderness with which Natasha spoke of him , the boy , who was only just beginning to guess what love is , derived the notion that his father had loved Natasha and when dying had left her to his friend . 
But the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured , and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture . 
So the boy also was happy that Pierre had arrived . 
The guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in .
