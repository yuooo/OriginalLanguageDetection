At night he would go out for booty and always brought back French clothing and weapons , and when told to would bring in French captives also . 
Denisov then relieved him from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the Cossacks . 
Tikhon did not like riding , and always went on foot , never lagging behind the cavalry . 
He was armed with a musketoon -LRB- which he carried rather as a joke -RRB- , a pike and an ax , which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth , with equal case picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones . 
Tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arm 's length , or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons .
