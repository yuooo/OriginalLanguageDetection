I am x in an indeterminate equation . 
I am a sort of phantom in life who has lost all beginning and end , and who has even forgotten his own name . 
You are laughing - no , you are not laughing , you are angry again . 
You are for ever angry , all you care about is intelligence , but I repeat again that I would give away all this superstellar life , all the ranks and honours , simply to be transformed into the soul of a merchant 's wife weighing eighteen stone and set candles at God 's shrine . '' 
`` Then even you do n't believe in God ? ''
