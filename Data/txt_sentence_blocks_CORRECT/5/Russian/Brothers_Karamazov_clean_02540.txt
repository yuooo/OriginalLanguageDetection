`` Oh , for a sum like that I can get all the village together , though by now they 're asleep . 
Are the peasants here worth such kindness , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , or the girls either ? 
To spend a sum like that on such coarseness and rudeness ! 
What 's the good of giving a peasant a cigar to smoke , the stinking ruffian ! 
And the girls are all lousy .
