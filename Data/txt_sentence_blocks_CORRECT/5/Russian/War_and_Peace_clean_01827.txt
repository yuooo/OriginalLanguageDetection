The men servants were carrying the large leather sofa from Prince Andrew 's study into the bedroom . 
On their faces was a quiet and solemn look . 
Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house , now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching what was going on in the passage . 
Some women passing with quiet steps in and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away . 
She did not venture to ask any questions , and shut the door again , now sitting down in her easy chair , now taking her prayer book , now kneeling before the icon stand .
