Another company , a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka , crowded round a pock-marked , broad-shouldered sergeant major who , tilting a keg , filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him . 
The soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces , emptied them , rolling the vodka in their mouths , and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions , licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats . 
All their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment , and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field . 
After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiers -- fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs -- near the shelter of the regimental commander , higher than and different from the others , Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man . 
Two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back .
