The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells . 
In place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation , he sees hundreds of dull , listless , and sleepy shells of bees . 
They have almost all died unawares , sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more . 
They reek of decay and death . 
Only a few of them still move , rise , and feebly fly to settle on the enemy 's hand , lacking the spirit to die stinging him ; the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales .
