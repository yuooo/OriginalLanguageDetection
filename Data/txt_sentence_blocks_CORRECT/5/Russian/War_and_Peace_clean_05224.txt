But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday : everywhere were blackened ruins , and the few Russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the French . 
It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed , but in place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed , Pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different , firm , French order had been established over this ruined nest . 
He felt this in the looks of the soldiers who , marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily , were escorting him and the other criminals ; he felt it in the looks of an important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier , whom they met on the way . 
He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field , and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out when he came that morning . 
Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men , and it seemed that they might have forgotten him , or confused him with the others .
