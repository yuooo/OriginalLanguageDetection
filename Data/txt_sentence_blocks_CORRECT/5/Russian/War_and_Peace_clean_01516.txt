The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead . 
Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes . 
Anywhere , on any side , one might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off . 
But the columns advanced for a long time , always in the same fog , descending and ascending hills , avoiding gardens and enclosures , going over new and unknown ground , and nowhere encountering the enemy . 
On the contrary , the soldiers became aware that in front , behind , and on all sides , other Russian columns were moving in the same direction .
