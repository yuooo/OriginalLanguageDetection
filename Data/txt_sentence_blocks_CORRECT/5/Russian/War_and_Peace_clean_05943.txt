The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode 's detachment , peasants from the adjacent villages , and residents who had fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity . 
The Russians who entered Moscow , finding it plundered , plundered it in their turn . 
They continued what the French had begun . 
Trains of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets . 
The Cossacks carried off what they could to their camps , and the householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their own , pretending that it was their property .
