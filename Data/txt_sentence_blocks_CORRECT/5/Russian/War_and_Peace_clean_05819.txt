A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them ; an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other 's presence . 
Sometimes they were silent for hours ; sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning . 
They spoke most of what was long past . 
Princess Mary spoke of her childhood , of her mother , her father , and her daydreams ; and Natasha , who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of devotion , submission , and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice , now feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection , learned to love her past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her . 
She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life , for she was accustomed to seek other joys , but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues .
