It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the baggage trains , and the prisoners , hemmed in on all sides , emerged onto the Kaluga road . 
They marched very quickly , without resting , and halted only when the sun began to set . 
The baggage carts drew up close together and the men began to prepare for their night 's rest . 
They all appeared angry and dissatisfied . 
For a long time , oaths , angry shouts , and fighting could be heard from all sides .
