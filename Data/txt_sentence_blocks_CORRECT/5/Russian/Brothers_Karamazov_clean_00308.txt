And besides that , there is still preserved , though only in thought , the judgment of the Church , which though no longer existing in practice is still living as a dream for the future , and is , no doubt , instinctively recognised by the criminal in his soul . 
What was said here just now is true too , that is , that if the jurisdiction of the Church were introduced in practice in its full force , that is , if the whole of the society were changed into the Church , not only the judgment of the Church would have influence on the reformation of the criminal such as it never has now , but possibly also the crimes themselves would be incredibly diminished . 
And there can be no doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and the crime of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed in restoring the excluded , in restraining those who plan evil , and in regenerating the fallen . 
It is true , '' said Father Zossima , with a smile , `` the Christian society now is not ready and is only resting on some seven righteous men , but as they are never lacking , it will continue still unshaken in expectation of its complete transformation from a society almost heathen in character into a single universal and all-powerful Church . 
So be it , so be it !
