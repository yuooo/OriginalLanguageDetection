`` I say this in case we become bad , '' Alyosha went on , `` but there 's no reason why we should become bad , is there , boys ? 
Let us be , first and above all , kind , then honest and then let us never forget each other ! 
I say that again . 
I give you my word for my part that I 'll never forget one of you . 
Every face looking at me now I shall remember even for thirty years .
