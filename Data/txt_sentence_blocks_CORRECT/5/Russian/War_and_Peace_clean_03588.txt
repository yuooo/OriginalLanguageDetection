Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits , as he himself had done when recounting them ; besides that , he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it . 
And so he did not like Zdrzhinski 's tale , nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who , with his mustaches extending over his cheeks , bent low over the face of his hearer , as was his habit , and crowded Rostov in the narrow shanty . 
Rostov looked at him in silence . 
`` In the first place , there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raevski did lead his sons there , it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him , '' thought he , `` the rest could not have seen how or with whom Raevski came onto the dam . 
And even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it , for what had they to do with Raevski 's tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger ?
