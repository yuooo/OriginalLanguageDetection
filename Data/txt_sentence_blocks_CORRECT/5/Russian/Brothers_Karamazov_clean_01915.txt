And the Russian monk has always been on the side of the people . 
We are isolated only if the people are isolated . 
The people believe as we do , and an unbelieving reformer will never do anything in Russia , even if he is sincere in heart and a genius . 
Remember that ! 
The people will meet the atheist and overcome him , and Russia will be one and orthodox .
