In front , at a weary gallop and using his leather whip , rode an officer , disheveled and drenched , whose trousers had worked up to above his knees . 
Behind him , standing in the stirrups , trotted a Cossack . 
The officer , a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes , galloped up to Denisov and handed him a sodden envelope . 
`` From the general , '' said the officer . 
`` Please excuse its not being quite dry . ''
