Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts , but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of September , orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the Rostovs ' and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rostovs ' and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated , entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow . 
The major-domo to whom these entreaties were addressed , though he was sorry for the wounded , resolutely refused , saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count . 
Pity these wounded men as one might , it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another , or all the carts and one 's own carriages as well . 
Thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one 's own family . 
So thought the major-domo on his master 's behalf .
