He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole sum with him at Mokroe , but that his money was in the town . 
Mitya observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure to pay him the remainder next day in the town . 
But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed the statement , and Mitya , after thinking for a moment admitted , frowning , that it must have been as the Poles stated , that he had been excited at the time , and might indeed have said so . 
The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence . 
It seemed to establish for the prosecution -LRB- and they did , in fact , base this deduction on it -RRB- that half , or a part of , the three thousand that had come into Mitya 's hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town , or even , perhaps , somewhere here , in Mokroe .
