A marvellous explanation ! 
This frantic , but weak man , who could not resist the temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at the price of such disgrace , this very man suddenly develops the most stoical firmness , and carries about a thousand roubles without daring to touch it . 
Does that fit in at all with the character we have analysed ? 
No , and I venture to tell you how the real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in such circumstances , if he really had brought himself to put away the money . 
`` At the first temptation - for instance , to entertain the woman with whom he had already squandered half the money - he would have unpicked his little bag and have taken out some hundred roubles , for why should he have taken back precisely half the money , that is , fifteen hundred roubles ?
