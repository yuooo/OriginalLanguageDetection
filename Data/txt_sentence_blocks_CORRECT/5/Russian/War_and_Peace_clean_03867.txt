Several limes in the old garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes . 
The shutters were all closed , except at one window which was open . 
A little serf boy , seeing Prince Andrew , ran into the house . 
Alpatych , having sent his family away , was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints . 
On hearing that Prince Andrew had come , he went out with his spectacles on his nose , buttoning his coat , and , hastily stepping up , without a word began weeping and kissing Prince Andrew 's knee .
