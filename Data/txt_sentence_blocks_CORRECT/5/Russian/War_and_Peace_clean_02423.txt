The fact that Speranski was the son of a village priest , and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble origin -LRB- as in fact many did -RRB- , caused Prince Andrew to cherish his sentiment for him the more , and unconsciously to strengthen it . 
On that first evening Bolkonski spent with him , having mentioned the Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws , Speranski told him sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty years , had cost millions , and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes . 
`` And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent , '' said he . 
`` We want to give the Senate new juridical powers , but we have no laws . 
That is why it is a sin for men like you , Prince , not to serve in these times ! ''
