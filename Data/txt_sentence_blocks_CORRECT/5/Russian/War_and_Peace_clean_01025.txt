As he was leaving the battery , firing was heard on the left also , and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself , Prince Bagration sent Zherkov to tell the general in command -LRB- the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutuzov at Braunau -RRB- that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear , as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy 's attack very long . 
About Tushin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten . 
Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagration 's colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and , to his surprise , found that no orders were really given , but that Prince Bagration tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity , by accident , or by the will of subordinate commanders was done , if not by his direct command , at least in accord with his intentions . 
Prince Andrew noticed , however , that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander 's will , owing to the tact Bagration showed , his presence was very valuable . 
Officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm ; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily , grew more cheerful in his presence , and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him .
