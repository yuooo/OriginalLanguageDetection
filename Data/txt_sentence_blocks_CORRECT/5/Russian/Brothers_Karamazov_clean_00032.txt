This alone showed the young man 's practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy and unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of the newspapers and journals , unable to think of anything better than everlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French . 
Having once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept up his connection with them , and in his latter years at the university he published brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects , so that he became well known in literary circles . 
But only in his last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle of readers , so that a great many people noticed and remembered him . 
It was rather a curious incident . 
When he had just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles , Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more important journals a strange article , which attracted general notice , on a subject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing , as he was a student of natural science .
