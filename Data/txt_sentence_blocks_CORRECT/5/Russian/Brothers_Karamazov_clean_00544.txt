There were also plantations of raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides ; a kitchen garden had been planted lately near the house . 
Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden . 
There , in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant , elder , snowball-tree , and lilac , there stood a tumbledown green summer-house ; blackened with age . 
Its walls were of lattice-work , but there was still a roof which could give shelter . 
God knows when this summer-house was built .
