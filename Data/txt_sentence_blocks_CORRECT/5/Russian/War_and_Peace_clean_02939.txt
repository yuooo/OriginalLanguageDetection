Nicholas , in his old lady 's dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat , stood in the middle of the sleigh , reins in hand . 
It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses , who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof . 
Natasha , Sonya , Madame Schoss , and two maids got into Nicholas ' sleigh ; Dimmler , his wife , and Petya , into the old count 's , and the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs . 
`` You go ahead , Zakhar ! '' 
shouted Nicholas to his father 's coachman , wishing for a chance to race past him .
