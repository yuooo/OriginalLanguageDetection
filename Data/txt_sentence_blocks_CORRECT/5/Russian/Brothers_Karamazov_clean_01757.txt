BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES -LRB- a -RRB- Father Zossima 's Brother . 
Beloved fathers and teachers , I was born in a distant province in the north , in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth , but of no great consequence or position . 
He died when I was only two years old , and I do n't remember him at all . 
He left my mother a small house built of wood , and a fortune , not large , but sufficient to keep her and her children in comfort . 
There were two of us , my elder brother Markel and I .
