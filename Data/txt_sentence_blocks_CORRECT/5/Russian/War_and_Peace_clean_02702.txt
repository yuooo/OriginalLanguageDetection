Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrew 's absence . 
He , as I wrote you before , has changed very much of late . 
After his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits . 
He has again become as I used to know him when a child : kind , affectionate , with that heart of gold to which I know no equal . 
He has realized , it seems to me , that life is not over for him .
