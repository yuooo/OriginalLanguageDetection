Five years ago , when Kuzma brought me here , I used to shut myself up , that no one might have sight or sound of me . 
I was a silly slip of a girl ; I used to sit here sobbing ; I used to lie awake all night , thinking : ` Where is he now , the man who wronged me ? 
He is laughing at me with another woman , most likely . 
If only I could see him , if I could meet him again , I 'd pay him out , I 'd pay him out ! ' 
At night I used to lie sobbing into my pillow in the dark , and I used to brood over it ; I used to tear my heart on purpose and gloat over my anger .
