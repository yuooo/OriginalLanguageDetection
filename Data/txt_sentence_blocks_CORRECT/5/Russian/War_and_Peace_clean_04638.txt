Sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china . 
Natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses , ribbons , and scarves strewn all about her , gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress -LRB- already out of fashion -RRB- which she had worn at her first Petersburg ball . 
Natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy , and several times that morning had tried to set to work , but her heart was not in it , and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might . 
For a while she had stood beside Sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help , but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things . 
At first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids , but when that was done and what was left had still to be packed , she found it dull .
