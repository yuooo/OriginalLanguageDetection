`` Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich , '' he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches , shoes , and a swallow-tail coat , who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing . 
The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall , and in her trodden-down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs . 
`` My dear , '' she said to her son , once more stimulating him by a touch , `` you promised me ! '' 
The son , lowering his eyes , followed her quietly . 
They entered the large hall , from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince Vasili .
