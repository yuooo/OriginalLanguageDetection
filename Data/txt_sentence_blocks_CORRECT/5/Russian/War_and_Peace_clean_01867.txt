In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before . 
Orders were given to raise recruits , ten men in every thousand for the regular army , and besides this , nine men in every thousand for the militia . 
Everywhere Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war was talked of . 
For the Rostov family the whole interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of remaining in Moscow , and only awaited the termination of Denisov 's furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment . 
His approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself , but rather gave zest to his pleasures .
