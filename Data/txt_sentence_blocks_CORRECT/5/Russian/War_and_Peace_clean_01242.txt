When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty . 
Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform , his chest expanded and his back drawn in , slightly swinging one foot , and , with his head a little bent , looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all . 
Anatole was not quick-witted , nor ready or eloquent in conversation , but he had the faculty , so invaluable in society , of composure and imperturbable self-possession . 
If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say , the effect is bad . 
But Anatole was dumb , swung his foot , and smilingly examined the princess ' hair .
