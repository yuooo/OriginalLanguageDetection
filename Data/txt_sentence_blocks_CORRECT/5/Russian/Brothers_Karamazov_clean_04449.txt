But we must one day begin life in sober earnest , we must look at ourselves as a society ; it 's time we tried to grasp something of our social position , or at least to make a beginning in that direction . 
`` A great writer * of the last epoch , comparing Russia to a swift troika galloping to an unknown goal , exclaims , ` Oh , troika , birdlike troika , who invented thee ! ' 
and adds , in proud ecstasy , that all the peoples of the world stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly galloping troika to pass . 
That may be , they may stand aside , respectfully or no , but in my poor opinion the great writer ended his book in this way either in an excess of childish and naive optimism , or simply in fear of the censorship of the day . 
For if the troika were drawn by his heroes , Sobakevitch , Nozdryov , Tchitchikov , it could reach no rational goal , whoever might be driving it .
