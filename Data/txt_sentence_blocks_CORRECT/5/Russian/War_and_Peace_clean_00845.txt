said the colonel triumphantly and gaily . 
`` And if he asks about the losses ? '' 
`` A trifle , '' said the colonel in his bass voice : `` two hussars wounded , and one knocked out , '' he added , unable to restrain a happy smile , and pronouncing the phrase `` knocked out '' with ringing distinctness . 
Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of Bonaparte , encountering a population that was unfriendly to it , losing confidence in its allies , suffering from shortness of supplies , and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen , the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded by Kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube , stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment . 
There had been actions at Lambach , Amstetten , and Melk ; but despite the courage and endurance -- acknowledged even by the enemy -- with which the Russians fought , the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat .
