Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon , and was left from childhood an orphan without relations . 
She grew up in the house of a general 's widow , a wealthy old lady of good position , who was at once her benefactress and tormentor . 
I do not know the details , but I have only heard that the orphan girl , a meek and gentle creature , was once cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in the loft , so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman , who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant through idleness . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer ; inquiries were made about him and he was refused . 
But again , as in his first marriage , he proposed an elopement to the orphan girl .
