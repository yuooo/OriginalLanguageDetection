Seeing a light in the little house to the right he went up , knocked at the shutters , and asked the man to whom the house belonged to help him carry the peasant to the police station , promising him three roubles . 
The man got ready and came out . 
I wo n't describe in detail how Ivan succeeded in his object , bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging for a doctor to see him at once , providing with a liberal hand for the expenses . 
I will only say that this business took a whole hour , but Ivan was well content with it . 
His mind wandered and worked incessantly .
