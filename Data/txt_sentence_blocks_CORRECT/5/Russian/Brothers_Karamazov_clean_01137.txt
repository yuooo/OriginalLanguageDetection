Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna 's must dominate , and she could only dominate someone like Dmitri , and never a man like Ivan . 
For Dmitri might - at last submit to her domination `` to his own happiness '' -LRB- which was what Alyosha would have desired -RRB- , but Ivan - no , Ivan could not submit to her , and such submission would not give him happiness . 
Alyosha could not help believing that of Ivan . 
And now all these doubts and reflections flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room . 
Another idea , too , forced itself upon him : `` What if she loved neither of them - neither Ivan nor Dmitri ? ''
