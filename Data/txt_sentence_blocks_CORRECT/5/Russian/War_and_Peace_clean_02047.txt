A bass voice -LRB- Pierre was still blindfold -RRB- questioned him as to who he was , when and where he was born , and so on . 
Then he was again led somewhere still blindfold , and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage , of holy friendship , of the Eternal Architect of the universe , and of the courage with which he should endure toils and dangers . 
During these wanderings , Pierre noticed that he was spoken of now as the `` Seeker , '' now as the `` Sufferer , '' and now as the `` Postulant , '' to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords . 
As he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors . 
He heard those around him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet .
