The voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council -- the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it -- no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past . 
All the advantages were on our side . 
Our enormous forces , undoubtedly superior to Napoleon 's , were concentrated in one place , the troops inspired by the Emperors ' presence were eager for action . 
The strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother : a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the French had now to be fought ; the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps , and Bonaparte , evidently weakened , was undertaking nothing . 
Dolgorukov , one of the warmest advocates of an attack , had just returned from the council , tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained .
