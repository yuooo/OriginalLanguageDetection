Carts piled high with household utensils , chairs , and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets . 
Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapontov 's and women were wailing and lamenting as they said good-by . 
A small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses . 
Alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went straight to the shed where his horses and trap were . 
The coachman was asleep .
