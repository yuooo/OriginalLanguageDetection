It was the cemetery gate closing . 
Fauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean , and all at once he bounded back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit . 
Jean Valjean 's eyes were open and gazing at him . 
To see a corpse is alarming , to behold a resurrection is almost as much so . 
Fauchelevent became like stone , pale , haggard , overwhelmed by all these excesses of emotion , not knowing whether he had to do with a living man or a dead one , and staring at Jean Valjean , who was gazing at him .
