`` Oh , I am convinced of that , '' said Fouquet , warmly ; `` your majesty knows very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in your hand , to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Peste ! '' 
cried the king ; `` I do not wish those fine fortifications , which cost so much to build , to fall at all . 
No , let them stand against the Dutch and English . 
You would not guess what I want to see at Belle - Isle , Monsieur Fouquet ; it is the pretty peasants and women of the lands on the sea-shore , who dance so well , and are so seducing with their scarlet petticoats !
