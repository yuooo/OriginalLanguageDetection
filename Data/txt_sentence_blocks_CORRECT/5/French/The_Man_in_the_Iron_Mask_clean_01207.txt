Athos and his son traversed France at the rate of fifteen leagues per day ; sometimes more , sometimes less , according to the intensity of Raoul 's grief . 
It took them a fortnight to reach Toulon , and they lost all traces of D'Artagnan at Antibes . 
They were forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous of preserving an incognito on his route , for Athos derived from his inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had exchanged his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon .

His affectionate heart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart of steel .
