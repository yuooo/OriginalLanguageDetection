And then , an unexpected bliss had happened to him , oil on the fire , a redoubling of the shadows over his eyes . 
One evening , at dusk , he had found , on the bench which `` M. Leblanc and his daughter '' had just quitted , a handkerchief , a very simple handkerchief , without embroidery , but white , and fine , and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume . 
He seized it with rapture . 
This handkerchief was marked with the letters U. F. Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child , -- neither her family name , her Christian name nor her abode ; these two letters were the first thing of her that he had gained possession of , adorable initials , upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding . 
U was evidently the Christian name .
