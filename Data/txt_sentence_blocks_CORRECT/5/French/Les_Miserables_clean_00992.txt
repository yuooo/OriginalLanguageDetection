While I was leading a bad life , I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me ; I could not have borne her sad , astonished eyes . 
It was for her sake that I did evil , and that is why God pardons me . 
I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette is here . 
I shall gaze at her ; it will do me good to see that innocent creature . 
She knows nothing at all .
