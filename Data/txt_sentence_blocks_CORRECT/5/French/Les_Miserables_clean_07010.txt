The thing came to pass simply , of itself , as the night comes when day is gone . 
LETTER TO M. DAELLI Publisher of the Italian translation of Les Miserables in Milan . 
HAUTEVILLE-HOUSE , October 18 , 1862 . 
You are right , sir , when you tell me that Les Miserables is written for all nations . 
I do not know whether it will be read by all , but I wrote it for all .
