`` I had no arms , '' murmured Aramis , as wild and terrible in his wrath as the shade of Dido . 
And then , without touching Fouquet 's hand , he turned his head aside , and stepped back a pace or two . 
His last word was an imprecation , his last gesture a curse , which his blood-stained hand seemed to invoke , as it sprinkled on Fouquet 's face a few drops of blood which flowed from his breast . 
And both of them darted out of the room by the secret staircase which led down to the inner courtyard . 
Fouquet ordered his best horses , while Aramis paused at the foot of the staircase which led to Porthos 's apartment .
