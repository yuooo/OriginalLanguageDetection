The queen - mother , who perceived Louis XIV. , and who held the hand of Philippe , uttered a cry of which we have spoken , as if she beheld a phantom . 
Monsieur was bewildered , and kept turning his head in astonishment from one to the other . 
Madame made a step forward , thinking she was looking at the form of her brother-in-law reflected in a mirror . 
And , in fact , the illusion was possible . 
The two princes , both pale as death - for we renounce the hope of being able to describe the fearful state of Philippe - trembling , clenching their hands convulsively , measured each other with looks , and darted their glances , sharp as poniards , at each other .
