Many men have a secret monster in this same manner , a dragon which gnaws them , a despair which inhabits their night . 
Such a man resembles other men , he goes and comes . 
No one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth , which lives within the unhappy man , and of which he is dying . 
No one knows that this man is a gulf . 
He is stagnant but deep .
