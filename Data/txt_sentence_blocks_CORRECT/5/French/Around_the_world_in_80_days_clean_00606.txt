Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the Platte River , because it was frozen . 
The road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind . 
But the breeze , far from lessening its force , blew as if to bend the mast , which , however , the metallic lashings held firmly . 
These lashings , like the chords of a stringed instrument , resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow . 
The sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody .
