A mayor does not offer his hand to a police spy . '' 
He added between his teeth : -- `` A police spy , yes ; from the moment when I have misused the police . 
I am no more than a police spy . '' 
Then he bowed profoundly , and directed his steps towards the door . 
There he wheeled round , and with eyes still downcast : -- `` Mr. Mayor , '' he said , `` I shall continue to serve until I am superseded . ''
