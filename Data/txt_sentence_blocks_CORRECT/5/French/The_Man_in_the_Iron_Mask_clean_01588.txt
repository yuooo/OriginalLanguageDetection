In the rapidity of the pursuit , and with the impatience of the avenger , animating himself as in war , D'Artagnan , so mild , so kind towards Fouquet , was surprised to find himself become ferocious - almost sanguinary . 
For a long time he galloped without catching sight of the white horse . 
His rage assumed fury , he doubted himself , - he suspected that Fouquet had buried himself in some subterranean road , or that he had changed the white horse for one of those famous black ones , as swift as the wind , which D'Artagnan , at Saint - Mande , had so frequently admired and envied for their vigor and their fleetness . 
At such moments , when the wind cut his eyes so as to make the tears spring from them , when the saddle had become burning hot , when the galled and spurred horse reared with pain , and threw behind him a shower of dust and stones , D'Artagnan , raising himself in his stirrups , and seeing nothing on the waters , nothing beneath the trees , looked up into the air like a madman . 
He was losing his senses .
