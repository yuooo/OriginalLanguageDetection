The shot sped , traversed the hand and possibly , also , the workman , since he fell , but the ball did not strike Marius . 
All this , which was rather to be apprehended than seen through the smoke , Marius , who was entering the tap-room , hardly noticed . 
Still , he had , in a confused way , perceived that gun-barrel aimed at him , and the hand which had blocked it , and he had heard the discharge . 
But in moments like this , the things which one sees vacillate and are precipitated , and one pauses for nothing . 
One feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still , and all is cloud .
