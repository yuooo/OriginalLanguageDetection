The head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut . 
It was a dog 's kennel . 
He was himself vigorous and formidable ; he armed himself with his staff , made a shield of his knapsack , and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could , not without enlarging the rents in his rags . 
He left the garden in the same manner , but backwards , being obliged , in order to keep the dog respectful , to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte . 
When he had , not without difficulty , repassed the fence , and found himself once more in the street , alone , without refuge , without shelter , without a roof over his head , chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel , he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone , and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim , `` I am not even a dog ! ''
