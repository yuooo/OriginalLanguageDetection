The king , in prison , will not be for you the cause of embarrassment that you have been for the king enthroned . 
His soul is naturally proud and impatient ; it is , moreover , disarmed and enfeebled , by being accustomed to honors , and by the license of supreme power . 
The same Providence which has willed that the concluding step in the geometrical calculation I have had the honor of describing to your royal highness should be your ascension to the throne , and the destruction of him who is hurtful to you , has also determined that the conquered one shall soon end both his own and your sufferings . 
Therefore , his soul and body have been adapted for but a brief agony . 
Put into prison as a private individual , left alone with your doubts , deprived of everything , you have exhibited the most sublime , enduring principle of life in withstanding all this .
