The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about nine o'clock , going always northeasterly ; and at midday reached Reno , where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast . 
From this point the road , running along Humboldt River , passed northward for several miles by its banks ; then it turned eastward , and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range , nearly at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada . 
Having breakfasted , Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams . 
Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam . 
These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks .
