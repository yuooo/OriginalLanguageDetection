As far as fire was concerned , as Marius had no fireplace , he had `` simplified matters . '' 
Marius always had two complete suits of clothes , the one old , `` for every day '' ; the other , brand new for special occasions . 
Both were black . 
He had but three shirts , one on his person , the second in the commode , and the third in the washerwoman 's hands . 
He renewed them as they wore out .
