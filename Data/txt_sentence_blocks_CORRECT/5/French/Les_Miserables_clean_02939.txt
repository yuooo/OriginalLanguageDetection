He had a father-in-law , a wealthy aunt , relatives , I do n't know exactly what all , who threatened to disinherit the child if he , the father , saw him . 
He sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day . 
He was separated from him because of political opinions . 
Certainly , I approve of political opinions , but there are people who do not know where to stop . 
Mon Dieu !
