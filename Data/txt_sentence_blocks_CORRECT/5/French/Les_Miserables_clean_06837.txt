There was one inconvenience about these clothes , they `` did not fit '' ; not having been made for those who wore them , they were too tight for one , too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one . 
Every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer 's costumes . 
It was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean . 
The changer had foreseen only ordinary men . 
He had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand , who is neither stout nor thin , neither tall nor short .
