Not even the long rows of windows and stores , the indentations of the chimneys , and the roofs , and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy pavements , were visible . 
An eye cast upward at that mass of shadows might , perhaps , have caught a glimpse here and there , at intervals , of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines , and profiles of singular buildings , something like the lights which go and come in ruins ; it was at such points that the barricades were situated . 
The rest was a lake of obscurity , foggy , heavy , and funereal , above which , in motionless and melancholy outlines , rose the tower of Saint-Jacques , the church of Saint-Merry , and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms . 
All around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth , in the quarters where the Parisian circulation had not been annihilated , and where a few street lanterns still burned , the aerial observer might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets , the dull rumble of artillery , and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute to minute ; a formidable girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection . 
The invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern ; everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless , and , as we have just seen , any street which one might come to offered nothing but darkness .
