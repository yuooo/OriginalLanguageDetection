The most simple of heart allied to the most crafty ; strength of body guided by subtlety of mind ; and in the decisive moment , when vigor alone could save mind and body , a stone , a rock , a vile material weight , triumphed over manly strength , and falling upon the body , drove out the mind . 
Worthy Porthos ! 
born to help other men , always ready to sacrifice himself for the safety of the weak , as if God had only given him strength for that purpose ; when dying he only thought he was carrying out the conditions of his compact with Aramis , a compact , however , which Aramis alone had drawn up , and which Porthos had only known to suffer by its terrible solidarity . 
Noble Porthos ! 
of what good now are thy chateaux overflowing with sumptuous furniture , forests overflowing with game , lakes overflowing with fish , cellars overflowing with wealth !
