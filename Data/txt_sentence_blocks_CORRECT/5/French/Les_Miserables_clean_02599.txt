The lame man who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent . 
The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar , the exit of Cosette , the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room , -- all had been executed without difficulty , and there had been no hitch . 
Let us remark in passing , that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight . 
It is one of the faults which resemble a duty . 
The nuns had committed it , not only without difficulty , but even with the applause of their own consciences .
