Beneath the cudgel , beneath the chain , in the cell , in hardship , beneath the burning sun of the galleys , upon the plank bed of the convict , he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated . 
He constituted himself the tribunal . 
He began by putting himself on trial . 
He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished . 
He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act ; that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it ; that , in any case , it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work ; that it is not an unanswerable argument to say , `` Can one wait when one is hungry ? ''
