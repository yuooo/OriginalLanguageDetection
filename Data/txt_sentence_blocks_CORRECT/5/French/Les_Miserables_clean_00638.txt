In their eyes it was liberty incarnate ; and as though to serve as pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the Piraeus , there stood on the public square in Corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat . 
The ingenuous police of the Restoration beheld the populace of Paris in too `` rose-colored '' a light ; it is not so much of `` an amiable rabble '' as it is thought . 
The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek : no one sleeps more soundly than he , no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he , no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness ; let him not be trusted nevertheless ; he is ready for any sort of cool deed ; but when there is glory at the end of it , he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury . 
Give him a pike , he will produce the 10th of August ; give him a gun , you will have Austerlitz . 
He is Napoleon 's stay and Danton 's resource .
