Europe is being ruined in this manner by exhaustion . 
As for France , we have just cited its figures . 
Now , Paris contains one twenty-fifth of the total population of France , and Parisian guano being the richest of all , we understate the truth when we value the loss on the part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard which France annually rejects . 
These twenty-five millions , employed in assistance and enjoyment , would double the splendor of Paris . 
The city spends them in sewers .
