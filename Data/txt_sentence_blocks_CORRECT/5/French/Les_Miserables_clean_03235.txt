From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates . 
An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him , forgetfulness of self and pity for all . 
As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers , gives , and lavishes to souls which stand open , and refuses to souls that are closed , he comes to pity , he the millionnaire of the mind , the millionnaire of money . 
All hatred departs from his heart , in proportion as light penetrates his spirit . 
And is he unhappy ?
