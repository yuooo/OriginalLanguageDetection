When he was with Cosette , they hid themselves in a recess near the steps , in order that they might neither be seen nor heard from the street , and there they sat , frequently contenting themselves , by way of conversation , with pressing each other 's hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the trees . 
At such times , a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from them , and they would not have noticed it , so deeply was the revery of the one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other . 
Limpid purity . 
Hours wholly white ; almost all alike . 
This sort of love is a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove .
