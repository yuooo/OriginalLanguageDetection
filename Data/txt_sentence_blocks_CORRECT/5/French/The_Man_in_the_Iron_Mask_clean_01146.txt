You are beloved , De Guiche , you are beloved ! 
You do not endure those atrocious nights , those nights without end , which , with arid eye and fainting heart , others pass through who are destined to die . 
You will live long , if you act like the miser who , bit by bit , crumb by crumb , collects and heaps up diamonds and gold . 
You are beloved ! 
- allow me to tell you what you must do that you may be beloved forever . ''
