And who , then , would forego the memory of those days of aurora and the firmament , of flowers , of gauze and of moire , when love stammers a charming slang ? 
Our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips ; thou didst mask the window with thy petticoat ; I took the earthenware bowl and I gave thee the Japanese cup . 
And those great misfortunes which made us laugh ! 
Thy cuff scorched , thy boa lost ! 
And that dear portrait of the divine Shakespeare which we sold one evening that we might sup !
