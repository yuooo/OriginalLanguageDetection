When the hour strikes , this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature ; this little man will arise , and his gaze will be terrible , and his breath will become a tempest , and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps . 
It is , thanks to the suburban man of Paris , that the Revolution , mixed with arms , conquers Europe . 
He sings ; it is his delight . 
Proportion his song to his nature , and you will see ! 
As long as he has for refrain nothing but la Carmagnole , he only overthrows Louis XVI. ; make him sing the Marseillaise , and he will free the world .
