Four feet of river flow past along the outside wall . 
The ground is always soaked . 
The occupant of the in pace had this wet soil for his bed . 
In one of these dungeons , there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to the wall ; in another , there can be seen a square box made of four slabs of granite , too short for a person to lie down in , too low for him to stand upright in . 
A human being was put inside , with a coverlid of stone on top .
