While they were thus embarrassed , a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop , by two unknown horsemen , who departed on the instant . 
The chest was opened ; it contained a cope of cloth of gold , a mitre ornamented with diamonds , an archbishop 's cross , a magnificent crosier , -- all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun . 
In the chest was a paper , on which these words were written , `` From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu . '' 
`` Did not I say that things would come right of themselves ? '' 
said the Bishop .
