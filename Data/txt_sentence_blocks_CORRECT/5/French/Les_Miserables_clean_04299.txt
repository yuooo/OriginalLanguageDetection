By degrees the outlines became fixed , although bathed in shadows . 
It was a vehicle , in fact , which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway , and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean ; a second , of the same aspect , followed , then a third , then a fourth ; seven chariots made their appearance in succession , the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front . 
Figures were moving on these vehicles , flashes were visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there , a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains , and as this something advanced , the sound of voices waxed louder , and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams . 
As it drew nearer , it assumed a form , and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition ; the mass grew white ; the day , which was slowly dawning , cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living , the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses , and this is what it proved to be : -- Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road . 
The first six were singularly constructed .
