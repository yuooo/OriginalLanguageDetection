Sir Francis was a tall , fair man of fifty , who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt . 
He made India his home , only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals ; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs , history , and character of India and its people . 
But Phileas Fogg , who was not travelling , but only describing a circumference , took no pains to inquire into these subjects ; he was a solid body , traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe , according to the laws of rational mechanics . 
He was at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from London , and , had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration , would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction . 
Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling companion -- although the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he was dealing the cards , and between two rubbers -- and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior , and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of nature .
