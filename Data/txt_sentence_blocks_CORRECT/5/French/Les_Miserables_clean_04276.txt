What ! 
I have been first , the most wretched of men , and then the most unhappy , and I have traversed sixty years of life on my knees , I have suffered everything that man can suffer , I have grown old without having been young , I have lived without a family , without relatives , without friends , without life , without children , I have left my blood on every stone , on every bramble , on every mile-post , along every wall , I have been gentle , though others have been hard to me , and kind , although others have been malicious , I have become an honest man once more , in spite of everything , I have repented of the evil that I have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me , and at the moment when I receive my recompense , at the moment when it is all over , at the moment when I am just touching the goal , at the moment when I have what I desire , it is well , it is good , I have paid , I have earned it , all this is to take flight , all this will vanish , and I shall lose Cosette , and I shall lose my life , my joy , my soul , because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg . '' 
Then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam . 
It was no longer a man gazing at a man ; it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy . 
It was a dog scanning a thief .
