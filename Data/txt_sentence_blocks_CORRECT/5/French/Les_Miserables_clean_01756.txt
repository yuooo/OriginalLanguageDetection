In the meantime , the unfortunate topman was losing his strength ; his anguish could not be discerned on his face , but his exhaustion was visible in every limb ; his arms were contracted in horrible twitchings ; every effort which he made to re-ascend served but to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope ; he did not shout , for fear of exhausting his strength . 
All were awaiting the minute when he should release his hold on the rope , and , from instant to instant , heads were turned aside that his fall might not be seen . 
There are moments when a bit of rope , a pole , the branch of a tree , is life itself , and it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and fall like a ripe fruit . 
All at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility of a tiger-cat ; this man was dressed in red ; he was a convict ; he wore a green cap ; he was a life convict . 
On arriving on a level with the top , a gust of wind carried away his cap , and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen : he was not a young man .
