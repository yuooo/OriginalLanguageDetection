`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` orders have only been given to such as were judged faithful . '' 
`` And , therefore , I have been astonished , sire , '' retorted the musketeer , `` that a captain like myself , who ranks with a marechal of France , should have found himself under the orders of five or six lieutenants or majors , good to make spies of , possibly , but not at all fit to conduct a warlike expedition . 
It was upon this subject I came to demand an explanation of your majesty , when I found the door closed against me , which , the final insult offered to a brave man , has led me to quit your majesty 's service . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the king , `` you still believe that you are living in an age when kings were , as you complain of having been , under the orders and at the discretion of their inferiors . 
You seem to forget that a king owes an account of his actions to none but God . ''
