Perhaps it was not altogether his fault . 
Listen , honorable judges ! 
a man who has been so greatly humbled as I have has neither any remonstrances to make to Providence , nor any advice to give to society ; but , you see , the infamy from which I have tried to escape is an injurious thing ; the galleys make the convict what he is ; reflect upon that , if you please . 
Before going to the galleys , I was a poor peasant , with very little intelligence , a sort of idiot ; the galleys wrought a change in me . 
I was stupid ; I became vicious : I was a block of wood ; I became a firebrand .
