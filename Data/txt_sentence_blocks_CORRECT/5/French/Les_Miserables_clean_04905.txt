M. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments , that his harsh reception had repelled the lad , that his hardness was driving him away ; he said all this to himself , and it augmented his grief ; and as his grief was straightway converted into wrath , it increased his harshness . 
He would have liked to have Marius understand , and Marius did not understand , which made the goodman furious . 
He began again : -- `` What ! 
you deserted me , your grandfather , you left my house to go no one knows whither , you drove your aunt to despair , you went off , it is easily guessed , to lead a bachelor life ; it 's more convenient , to play the dandy , to come in at all hours , to amuse yourself ; you have given me no signs of life , you have contracted debts without even telling me to pay them , you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer , and , at the end of four years , you come to me , and that is all you have to say to me ! ''
