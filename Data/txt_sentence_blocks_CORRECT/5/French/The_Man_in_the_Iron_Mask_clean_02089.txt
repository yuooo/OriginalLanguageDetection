`` God forbid , '' said he , `` that I should confound the innocent with the guilty . 
They know me but ill who doubt my mercy towards the weak . 
I strike none but the arrogant . 
Do , messieurs , do all that your hearts counsel you to assuage the grief of Madame Fouquet . 
Go , messieurs - go ! ''
