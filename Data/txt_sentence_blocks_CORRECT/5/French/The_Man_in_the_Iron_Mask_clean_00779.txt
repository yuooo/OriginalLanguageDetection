In vivid contrast to the sad and terrible destiny of the king imprisoned in the Bastile , and tearing , in sheer despair , the bolts and bars of his dungeon , the rhetoric of the chroniclers of old would not fail to present , as a complete antithesis , the picture of Philippe lying asleep beneath the royal canopy . 
We do not pretend to say that such rhetoric is always bad , and always scatters , in places where they have no right to grow , the flowers with which it embellishes and enlivens history . 
But we shall , on the present occasion , carefully avoid polishing the antithesis in question , but shall proceed to draw another picture as minutely as possible , to serve as foil and counterfoil to the one in the preceding chapter . 
The young prince alighted from Aramis 's room , in the same way the king had descended from the apartment dedicated to Morpheus . 
The dome gradually and slowly sank down under Aramis 's pressure , and Philippe stood beside the royal bed , which had ascended again after having deposited its prisoner in the secret depths of the subterranean passage .
