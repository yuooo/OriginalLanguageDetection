THE LARK 'S MEADOW Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set Javert ; but Javert had no sooner quitted the building , bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches , than Marius also glided out of the house . 
It was only nine o'clock in the evening . 
Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac . 
Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin Quarter , he had gone to live in the Rue de la Verrerie `` for political reasons '' ; this quarter was one where , at that epoch , insurrection liked to install itself . 
Marius said to Courfeyrac : `` I have come to sleep with you . ''
