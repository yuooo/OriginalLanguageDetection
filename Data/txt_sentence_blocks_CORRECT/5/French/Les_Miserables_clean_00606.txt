Fantine was beautiful , and remained pure as long as she could . 
She was a lovely blonde , with fine teeth . 
She had gold and pearls for her dowry ; but her gold was on her head , and her pearls were in her mouth . 
She worked for her living ; then , still for the sake of her living , -- for the heart , also , has its hunger , -- she loved . 
She loved Tholomyes .
