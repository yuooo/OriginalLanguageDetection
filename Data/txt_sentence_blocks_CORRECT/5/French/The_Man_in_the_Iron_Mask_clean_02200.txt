pardon ! '' 
And as she appeared to abandon herself entirely to her grief , as she threw herself down , almost fainting , exhausted by complaints and prayers , D'Artagnan , touched by this love for his so much regretted friends , made a few steps towards the grave , in order to interrupt the melancholy colloquy of the penitent with the dead .
