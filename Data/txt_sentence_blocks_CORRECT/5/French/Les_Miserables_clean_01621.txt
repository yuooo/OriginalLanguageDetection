The army yielded suddenly on all sides at once , -- Hougomont , La Haie-Sainte , Papelotte , Plancenoit . 
The cry `` Treachery ! '' 
was followed by a cry of `` Save yourselves who can ! '' 
An army which is disbanding is like a thaw . 
All yields , splits , cracks , floats , rolls , falls , jostles , hastens , is precipitated .
