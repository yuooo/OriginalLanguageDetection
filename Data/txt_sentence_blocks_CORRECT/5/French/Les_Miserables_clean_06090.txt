The keyhole could be seen , and the robust latch , deeply sunk in the iron staple . 
The door was plainly double-locked . 
It was one of those prison locks which old Paris was so fond of lavishing . 
Beyond the grating was the open air , the river , the daylight , the shore , very narrow but sufficient for escape . 
The distant quays , Paris , that gulf in which one so easily hides oneself , the broad horizon , liberty .
