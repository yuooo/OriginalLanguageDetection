Several minutes passed thus , then a sound of footsteps , measured , heavy , and numerous , became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu . 
This sound , faint at first , then precise , then heavy and sonorous , approached slowly , without halt , without intermission , with a tranquil and terrible continuity . 
Nothing was to be heard but this . 
It was that combined silence and sound , of the statue of the commander , but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng , and , at the same time , the idea of a spectre . 
One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marching onward .
