Fouquet still wrote : `` Order for every soldier , citizen , or gentleman to seize and apprehend , wherever he may be found , le Chevalier d'Herblay , Eveque de Vannes , and his accomplices , who are : first , M. de Baisemeaux , governor of the Bastile , suspected of the crimes of high treason and rebellion - '' `` Stop , monseigneur ! '' 
cried Baisemeaux ; `` I do not understand a single jot of the whole matter ; but so many misfortunes , even were it madness itself that had set them at their awful work , might happen here in a couple of hours , that the king , by whom I must be judged , will see whether I have been wrong in withdrawing the countersign before this flood of imminent catastrophes . 
Come with me to the keep , monseigneur , you shall see Marchiali . '' 
Fouquet darted out of the room , followed by Baisemeaux as he wiped the perspiration from his face . 
`` What a terrible morning ! ''
