The ridge which the soil of Paris forms on its right bank empties one of its water-sheds into the Seine and the other into the Grand Sewer . 
The crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line . 
The culminating point , which is the point of separation of the currents , is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer , beyond the Rue Michelle-Comte , in the sewer of the Louvre , near the boulevards , and in the Montmartre sewer , near the Halles . 
It was this culminating point that Jean Valjean had reached . 
He was directing his course towards the belt sewer ; he was on the right path .
