Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thenardier and the prisoner . 
These men , through the black masks or paste which covered their faces , and made of them , at fear 's pleasure , charcoal-burners , negroes , or demons , had a stupid and gloomy air , and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work , tranquilly , without either wrath or mercy , with a sort of ennui . 
They were crowded together in one corner like brutes , and remained silent . 
Thenardier warmed his feet .
