Mr. Fogg went to bed , but did he sleep ? 
Aouda did not once close her eyes . 
Passepartout watched all night , like a faithful dog , at his master 's door . 
Mr. Fogg called him in the morning , and told him to get Aouda 's breakfast , and a cup of tea and a chop for himself . 
He desired Aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner , as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights .
