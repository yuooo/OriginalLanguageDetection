That night , Thenardier was warned , without any one being able to explain how , and was not asleep . 
Towards one o'clock in the morning , the night being very dark , he saw two shadows pass along the roof , in the rain and squalls , in front of the dormer-window which was opposite his cage . 
One halted at the window , long enough to dart in a glance . 
This was Brujon . 
Thenardier recognized him , and understood .
