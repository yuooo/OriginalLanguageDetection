This gentleman was known as M. Bamatabois . 
The woman , a melancholy , decorated spectre which went and came through the snow , made him no reply , did not even glance at him , and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence , and with a sombre regularity , which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm , like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods . 
The small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger ; and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned , he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf , and stifling his laugh , bent down , picked up a handful of snow from the pavement , and thrust it abruptly into her back , between her bare shoulders . 
The woman uttered a roar , whirled round , gave a leap like a panther , and hurled herself upon the man , burying her nails in his face , with the most frightful words which could fall from the guard-room into the gutter . 
These insults , poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy , did , indeed , proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth .
