`` She may , '' replied the policeman . 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri , a sort of four-wheeled carriage , drawn by two horses , in which they took their places and were driven away . 
No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination . 
They first passed through the `` black town , '' with its narrow streets , its miserable , dirty huts , and squalid population ; then through the `` European town , '' which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions , shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts , where , although it was early morning , elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth . 
The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house , which , however , did not have the appearance of a private mansion .
