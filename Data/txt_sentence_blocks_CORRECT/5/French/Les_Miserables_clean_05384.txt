All turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded . 
Marius had entered the tap-room , and had seized the barrel of powder , then he had taken advantage of the smoke , and the sort of obscure mist which filled the entrenched enclosure , to glide along the barricade as far as that cage of paving-stones where the torch was fixed . 
To tear it from the torch , to replace it by the barrel of powder , to thrust the pile of stones under the barrel , which was instantly staved in , with a sort of horrible obedience , -- all this had cost Marius but the time necessary to stoop and rise again ; and now all , National Guards , Municipal Guards , officers , soldiers , huddled at the other extremity of the barricade , gazed stupidly at him , as he stood with his foot on the stones , his torch in his hand , his haughty face illuminated by a fatal resolution , drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable pile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder , and giving vent to that startling cry : -- `` Be off with you , or I 'll blow up the barricade ! '' 
Marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the young revolution after the apparition of the old . 
`` Blow up the barricade ! ''
