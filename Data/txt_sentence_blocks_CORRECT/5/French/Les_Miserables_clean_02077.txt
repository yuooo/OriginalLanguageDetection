It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand , all cracked with chilblains , and kissed it . 
The poor child , who was used to being beaten , did not know the meaning of this , and ran away in confusion . 
At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown . 
Cosette was no longer in rags ; she was in mourning . 
She had emerged from misery , and she was entering into life .
