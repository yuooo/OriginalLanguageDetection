At the time of the Emperor 's landing , many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the Three Dauphins . 
It was said that General Bertrand , disguised as a carter , had made frequent trips thither in the month of January , and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens . 
The truth is , that when the Emperor entered Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture ; he had thanked the mayor , saying , `` I am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance '' ; and he had betaken himself to the Three Dauphins . 
This glory of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins was reflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas , at a distance of five and twenty leagues . 
It was said of him in the town , `` That is the cousin of the man of Grenoble . ''
