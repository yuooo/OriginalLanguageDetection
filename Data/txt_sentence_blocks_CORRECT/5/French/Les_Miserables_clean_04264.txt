Every day , she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience , she found Marius there , she felt herself unspeakably happy , and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to Jean Valjean : -- `` What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is ! '' 
Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another . 
They did not address each other , they did not salute each other , they did not know each other ; they saw each other ; and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues , they lived by gazing at each other . 
It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed , beautiful and loving , with a consciousness of her beauty , and in ignorance of her love . 
She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance .
