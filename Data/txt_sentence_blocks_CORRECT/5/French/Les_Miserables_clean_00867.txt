This old dame had once been young -- astonishing fact ! 
In her youth , in ' 93 , she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap , and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins . 
She was dry , rough , peevish , sharp , captious , almost venomous ; all this in memory of her monk , whose widow she was , and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will . 
She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible . 
At the Restoration she had turned bigot , and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk .
