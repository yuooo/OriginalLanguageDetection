At Issy an incident occurred . 
The truly national park , at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor , happened to be wide open . 
They passed the gates , visited the manikin anchorite in his grotto , tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet of mirrors , the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus . 
They had stoutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the Abbe de Bernis . 
As he swung these beauties , one after the other , producing folds in the fluttering skirts which Greuze would have found to his taste , amid peals of laughter , the Toulousan Tholomyes , who was somewhat of a Spaniard , Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa , sang , to a melancholy chant , the old ballad gallega , probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon a rope between two trees : -- `` Soy de Badajoz , `` Badajoz is my home , Amor me llama , And Love is my name ; Toda mi alma , To my eyes in flame , Es en mi ojos , All my soul doth come ; Porque ensenas , For instruction meet A tuas piernas .
