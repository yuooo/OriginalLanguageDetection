-LSB- 16 -RSB- The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission , as we have already stated , to be buried there in a corner apart , and at night , the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community . 
The grave-diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter , in this cemetery , they were subjected to a special discipline . 
The gates of the Paris cemeteries closed , at that epoch , at sundown , and this being a municipal regulation , the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest . 
The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates , adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet , and inhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery . 
These gates , therefore , swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides .
