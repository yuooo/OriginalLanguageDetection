He passed the dead in some sort of hideous review . 
He walked with his feet in the blood . 
All at once he paused . 
A few paces in front of him , in the hollow road , at the point where the pile of dead came to an end , an open hand , illumined by the moon , projected from beneath that heap of men . 
That hand had on its finger something sparkling , which was a ring of gold .
