Ten o'clock had sounded from Saint-Merry . 
Enjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves , carbines in hand , near the outlet of the grand barricade . 
They no longer addressed each other , they listened , seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound of marching . 
Suddenly , in the midst of the dismal calm , a clear , gay , young voice , which seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis , rose and began to sing distinctly , to the old popular air of `` By the Light of the Moon , '' this bit of poetry , terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock : -- Mon nez est en larmes , Mon ami Bugeaud , Prete moi tes gendarmes Pour leur dire un mot . 
En capote bleue , La poule au shako , Voici la banlieue !
