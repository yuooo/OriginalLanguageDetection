What a pity ! 
Poor child ! '' 
This child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago . 
He was called `` poor child , '' because he had for a father `` a brigand of the Loire . '' 
This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand 's son-in-law , who has already been mentioned , and whom M. Gillenormand called `` the disgrace of his family . ''
