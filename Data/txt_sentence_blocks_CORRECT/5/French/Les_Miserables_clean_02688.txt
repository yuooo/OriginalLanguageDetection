`` And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery . '' 
And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor . 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
demanded Gribier . 
`` The meaning of it is , that you dropped your card out of your pocket , that I found it on the ground after you were gone , that I have buried the corpse , that I have filled the grave , that I have done your work , that the porter will return your card to you , and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs .
