It is done . 
I can not seek redress from those who employ you , - they are unknown to me , or are at too great a distance . 
But you are under my hand , and I swear that if you make one step behind me when I raise my feet to go up to those gentlemen , I swear to you by my name , I will cleave your head in two with my sword , and pitch you into the water . 
Oh ! 
it will happen !
