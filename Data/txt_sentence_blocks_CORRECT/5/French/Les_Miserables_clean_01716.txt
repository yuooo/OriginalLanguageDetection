It bears the date of July 25 , 1823 . 
An arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course . 
A man , who was a stranger in the Department , and who bore the name of M. Madeleine , had , thanks to the new methods , resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry , the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets . 
He had made his fortune in the business , and that of the arrondissement as well , we will admit . 
He had been appointed mayor , in recognition of his services .
