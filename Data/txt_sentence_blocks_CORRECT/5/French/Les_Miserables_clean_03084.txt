Grantaire , in whom writhed doubt , loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras . 
He had need of Enjolras . 
That chaste , healthy , firm , upright , hard , candid nature charmed him , without his being clearly aware of it , and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him . 
He admired his opposite by instinct . 
His soft , yielding , dislocated , sickly , shapeless ideas attached themselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column .
