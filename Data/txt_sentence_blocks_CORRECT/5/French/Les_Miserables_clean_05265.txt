Oh ! 
what sighs from our hearts full of gloom fluttered forth to the heavenly depths ! 
The hour , the spot , these souvenirs of youth recalled , a few stars which began to twinkle in the sky , the funeral repose of those deserted streets , the imminence of the inexorable adventure , which was in preparation , gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low tone in the dusk by Jean Prouvaire , who , as we have said , was a gentle poet . 
In the meantime , a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade , and in the large one , one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on Shrove-Tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks , on their way to la Courtille . 
These torches , as the reader has seen , came from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine .
