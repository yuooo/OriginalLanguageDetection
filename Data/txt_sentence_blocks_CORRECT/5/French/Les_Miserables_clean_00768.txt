Her daughters received nothing but caresses . 
Cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement . 
The sweet , feeble being , who should not have understood anything of this world or of God , incessantly punished , scolded , ill-used , beaten , and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself , who lived in a ray of dawn ! 
Madame Thenardier was vicious with Cosette . 
Eponine and Azelma were vicious .
