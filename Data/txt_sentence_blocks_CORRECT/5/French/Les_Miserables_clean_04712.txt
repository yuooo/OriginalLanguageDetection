The secret is the thing above all others . 
The secret , in the eyes of these wretches , is unity which serves as a base of union .

To inform against , in the energetic slang dialect , is called : `` to eat the bit . '' 
As though the informer drew to himself a little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each one 's flesh .
