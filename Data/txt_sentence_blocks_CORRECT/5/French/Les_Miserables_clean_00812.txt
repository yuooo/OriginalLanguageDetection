The heart , that obscure , celestial flower , undergoes a mysterious blossoming . 
One would not exchange that shadow for all brightness ! 
The angel soul is there , uninterruptedly there ; if she departs , it is but to return again ; she vanishes like a dream , and reappears like reality . 
One feels warmth approaching , and behold ! 
she is there .
