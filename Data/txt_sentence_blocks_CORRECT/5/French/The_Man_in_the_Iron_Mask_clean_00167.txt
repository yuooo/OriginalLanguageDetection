He left a son and a daughter , both worthy of the name they were called upon to bear ; the son , a cutter as unerring and exact as the square rule ; the daughter , apt at embroidery , and at designing ornaments . 
The marriage of Henry IV . 
and Marie de Medici , and the exquisite court-mourning for the afore-mentioned queen , together with a few words let fall by M. de Bassompiere , king of the beaux of the period , made the fortune of the second generation of Percerins . 
M. Concino Concini , and his wife Galligai , who subsequently shone at the French court , sought to Italianize the fashion , and introduced some Florentine tailors ; but Percerin , touched to the quick in his patriotism and his self-esteem , entirely defeated these foreigners , and that so well that Concino was the first to give up his compatriots , and held the French tailor in such esteem that he would never employ any other , and thus wore a doublet of his on the very day that Vitry blew out his brains with a pistol at the Pont du Louvre . 
And so it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin 's workshop , which the Parisians rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human body it contained .
