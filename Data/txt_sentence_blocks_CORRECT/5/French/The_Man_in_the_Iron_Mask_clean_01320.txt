Nothing prepared me ; I fell once , and that once deprived me of courage for the whole of my life . 
It is quite true that I wrecked myself . 
Oh , no , monsieur ! 
you are nothing in my past but happiness - in my future but hope ! 
No , I have no reproach to make against life such as you made it for me ; I bless you , and I love you ardently . ''
