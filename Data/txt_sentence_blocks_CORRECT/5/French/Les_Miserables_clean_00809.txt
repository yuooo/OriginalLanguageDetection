The Bishop of D -- -- to supply here a detail which the papers omitted -- had been blind for many years before his death , and content to be blind , as his sister was beside him . 
Let us remark by the way , that to be blind and to be loved , is , in fact , one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth , where nothing is complete . 
To have continually at one 's side a woman , a daughter , a sister , a charming being , who is there because you need her and because she can not do without you ; to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us ; to be able to incessantly measure one 's affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us , and to say to ourselves , `` Since she consecrates the whole of her time to me , it is because I possess the whole of her heart '' ; to behold her thought in lieu of her face ; to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world ; to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound of wings ; to hear her come and go , retire , speak , return , sing , and to think that one is the centre of these steps , of this speech ; to manifest at each instant one 's personal attraction ; to feel one 's self all the more powerful because of one 's infirmity ; to become in one 's obscurity , and through one 's obscurity , the star around which this angel gravitates , -- few felicities equal this . 
The supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved ; loved for one 's own sake -- let us say rather , loved in spite of one 's self ; this conviction the blind man possesses . 
To be served in distress is to be caressed .
