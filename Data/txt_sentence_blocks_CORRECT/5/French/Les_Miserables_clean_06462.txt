Pardieu , I decree joy ! 
Evil has no right to exist . 
That there should be any unhappy men is , in sooth , a disgrace to the azure of the sky . 
Evil does not come from man , who is good at bottom . 
All human miseries have for their capital and central government hell , otherwise , known as the Devil 's Tuileries .
