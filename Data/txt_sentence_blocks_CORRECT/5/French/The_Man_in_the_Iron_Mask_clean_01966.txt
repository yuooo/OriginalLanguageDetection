An hour passed thus , during which daylight gradually disappeared , but during which also the sail in view gained so swiftly on the bark , that Goenne , one of the three sailors , ventured to say aloud : `` Monseigneur , we are being chased ! '' 
Aramis made no reply ; the ship still gained upon them . 
Then , of their own accord , two of the sailors , by the direction of the patron Yves , lowered the sail , in order that that single point upon the surface of the waters should cease to be a guide to the eye of the enemy pursuing them . 
On the part of the ship in sight , on the contrary , two more small sails were run up at the extremities of the masts .
