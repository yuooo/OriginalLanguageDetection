Silence always produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence , of the enemy being driven to the wall . 
Marius continued with increased enthusiasm , and almost without pausing for breath : -- `` Let us be just , my friends ! 
What a splendid destiny for a nation to be the Empire of such an Emperor , when that nation is France and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man ! 
To appear and to reign , to march and to triumph , to have for halting-places all capitals , to take his grenadiers and to make kings of them , to decree the falls of dynasties , and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge ; to make you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of God ; to follow in a single man , Hannibal , Caesar , Charlemagne ; to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of a battle won , to have the cannon of the Invalides to rouse you in the morning , to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words which flame forever , Marengo , Arcola , Austerlitz , Jena , Wagram ! 
To cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries , to make the French Empire a pendant to the Roman Empire , to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army , to make its legions fly forth over all the earth , as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer , to dominate , to strike with lightning , to be in Europe a sort of nation gilded through glory , to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of Titans , to conquer the world twice , by conquest and by dazzling , that is sublime ; and what greater thing is there ?
