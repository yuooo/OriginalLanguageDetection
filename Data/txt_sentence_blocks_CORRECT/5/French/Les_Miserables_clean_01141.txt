because it would have pleased me to play the grand and generous ; this is melodrama , after all ; because I should have thought of no one but myself , the idea ! 
for the sake of saving from a punishment , a trifle exaggerated , perhaps , but just at bottom , no one knows whom , a thief , a good-for-nothing , evidently , a whole country-side must perish ! 
a poor woman must die in the hospital ! 
a poor little girl must die in the street ! 
like dogs ; ah , this is abominable !
