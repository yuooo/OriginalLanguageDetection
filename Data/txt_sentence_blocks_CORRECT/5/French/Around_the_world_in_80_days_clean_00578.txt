No train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from Omaha to San Francisco was not due till the next day . 
The mystery was soon explained . 
The locomotive , which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles , was that which , having been detached from the train , had continued its route with such terrific rapidity , carrying off the unconscious engineer and stoker . 
It had run several miles , when , the fire becoming low for want of fuel , the steam had slackened ; and it had finally stopped an hour after , some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney . 
Neither the engineer nor the stoker was dead , and , after remaining for some time in their swoon , had come to themselves .
