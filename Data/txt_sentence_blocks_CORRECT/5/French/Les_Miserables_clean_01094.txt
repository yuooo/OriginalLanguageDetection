There is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation . 
The eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man ; it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable , more complicated , more mysterious , and more infinite . 
There is a spectacle more grand than the sea ; it is heaven : there is a spectacle more grand than heaven ; it is the inmost recesses of the soul . 
To make the poem of the human conscience , were it only with reference to a single man , were it only in connection with the basest of men , would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic . 
Conscience is the chaos of chimeras , of lusts , and of temptations ; the furnace of dreams ; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed ; it is the pandemonium of sophisms ; it is the battlefield of the passions .
