It often occurred that he forgot the day had half passed away , that the hours for the two first meals were gone by . 
Then he was awakened . 
He rose , descended to his shady walk , then came out a little into the sun , as though to partake of its warmth for a minute in memory of his absent child . 
And then the dismal monotonous walk recommenced , until , exhausted , he regained the chamber and his bed , his domicile by choice . 
For several days the comte did not speak a single word .
