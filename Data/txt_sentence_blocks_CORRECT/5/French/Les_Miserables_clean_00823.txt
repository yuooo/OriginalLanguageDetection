Now , if the reader will admit , for a moment , with us , that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation , it will be easy for us to say what there was in Police Officer Javert . 
The peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog , which is killed by the mother because , otherwise , as he grew up , he would devour the other little ones . 
Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face , and the result will be Javert .

As he grew up , he thought that he was outside the pale of society , and he despaired of ever re-entering it .
