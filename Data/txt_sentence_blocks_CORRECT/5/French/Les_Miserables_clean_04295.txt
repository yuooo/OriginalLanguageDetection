It was not dawn , it was daybreak ; a delightful and stern moment . 
A few constellations here and there in the deep , pale azure , the earth all black , the heavens all white , a quiver amid the blades of grass , everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight . 
A lark , which seemed mingled with the stars , was carolling at a prodigious height , and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity . 
In the East , the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel ; Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice . 
All was peace and silence ; there was no one on the road ; a few stray laborers , of whom they caught barely a glimpse , were on their way to their work along the side-paths .
