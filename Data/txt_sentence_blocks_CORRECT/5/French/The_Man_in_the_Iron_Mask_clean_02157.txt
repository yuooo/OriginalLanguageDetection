God willed , no doubt , to open to this elect the treasures of eternal beatitude , at this hour when other men tremble with the idea of being severely received by the Lord , and cling to this life they know , in the dread of the other life of which they get but merest glimpses by the dismal murky torch of death . 
Athos was spirit-guided by the pure serene soul of his son , which aspired to be like the paternal soul . 
Everything for this just man was melody and perfume in the rough road souls take to return to the celestial country . 
After an hour of this ecstasy , Athos softly raised his hands as white as wax ; the smile did not quit his lips , and he murmured low , so low as scarcely to be audible , these three words addressed to God or to Raoul : `` HERE I AM ! '' 
And his hands fell slowly , as though he himself had laid them on the bed .
