Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times , warning him of his peril , beseeching him to withdraw , but he did not hear them . 
When they were not speaking to him , his mouth moved as though he were replying to some one , and as soon as he was addressed , his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive . 
Several hours before the barricade was attacked , he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon , with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice . 
Nothing had been able to move him from this attitude ; it did not seem as though his mind were in the barricade . 
When each had gone to take up his position for the combat , there remained in the tap-room where Javert was bound to the post , only a single insurgent with a naked sword , watching over Javert , and himself , Mabeuf .
