From that moment forth , all was over ; the Ogre of Corsica , -- the usurper , -- the tyrant , -- the monster who was the lover of his own sisters , -- the actor who took lessons of Talma , -- the poisoner of Jaffa , -- the tiger , -- Buonaparte , -- all this vanished , and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone , at an inaccessible height , the pale marble phantom of Caesar . 
The Emperor had been for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires , for whom one sacrifices one 's self ; he was something more to Marius . 
He was the predestined constructor of the French group , succeeding the Roman group in the domination of the universe . 
He was a prodigious architect , of a destruction , the continuer of Charlemagne , of Louis XI. , of Henry IV. , of Richelieu , of Louis XIV. , and of the Committee of Public Safety , having his spots , no doubt , his faults , his crimes even , being a man , that is to say ; but august in his faults , brilliant in his spots , powerful in his crime . 
He was the predestined man , who had forced all nations to say : `` The great nation ! ''
