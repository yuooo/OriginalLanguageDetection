A forgetful , dissipated , indifferent life would be beyond my strength , now I have no longer Raoul with me . 
You do not ask the lamp to burn when the match has not illumed the flame ; do not ask me to live amidst noise and merriment . 
I vegetate , I prepare myself , I wait . 
Look , doctor ; remember those soldiers we have so often seen together at the ports , where they were waiting to embark ; lying down , indifferent , half on one element , half on the other ; they were neither at the place where the sea was going to carry them , nor at the place the earth was going to lose them ; baggage prepared , minds on the stretch , arms stacked - they waited . 
I repeat it , the word is the one which paints my present life .
