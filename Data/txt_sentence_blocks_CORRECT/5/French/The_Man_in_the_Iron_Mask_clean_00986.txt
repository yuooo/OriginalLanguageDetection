`` Well , my son , '' said she , `` are you convinced with regard to M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Saint-Aignan , '' said Philippe , `` have the goodness to go and inquire after the queen . '' 
At these words , the first Philippe had pronounced aloud , the slight difference that there was between his voice and that of the king was sensible to maternal ears , and Anne of Austria looked earnestly at her son . 
Saint-Aignan left the room , and Philippe continued : `` Madame , I do not like to hear M. Fouquet ill-spoken of , you know I do not - and you have even spoken well of him yourself . '' 
`` That is true ; therefore I only question you on the state of your sentiments with respect to him . ''
