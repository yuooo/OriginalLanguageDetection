As I have said , this spectacle did not last above two seconds . 
During this short space of time an officer of the third brigade got together eight men armed with muskets , and , through an opening , ordered them to fire upon Porthos . 
But they who received the order to fire trembled so that three guards fell by the discharge , and the five remaining balls hissed on to splinter the vault , plow the ground , or indent the pillars of the cavern . 
A burst of laughter replied to this volley ; then the arm of the giant swung round ; then was seen whirling through the air , like a falling star , the train of fire . 
The barrel , hurled a distance of thirty feet , cleared the barricade of dead bodies , and fell amidst a group of shrieking soldiers , who threw themselves on their faces .
