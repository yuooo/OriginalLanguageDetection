This wall was built of paving-stones . 
It was straight , correct , cold , perpendicular , levelled with the square , laid out by rule and line . 
Cement was lacking , of course , but , as in the case of certain Roman walls , without interfering with its rigid architecture . 
The entablature was mathematically parallel with the base . 
From distance to distance , one could distinguish on the gray surface , almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads .
