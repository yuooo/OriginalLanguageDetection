Although a bourgeois , M. Gillenormand was received in society . 
As he had a double measure of wit , in the first place , that which was born with him , and secondly , that which was attributed to him , he was even sought out and made much of . 
He never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there . 
There are people who will have influence at any price , and who will have other people busy themselves over them ; when they can not be oracles , they turn wags . 
M. Gillenormand was not of this nature ; his domination in the Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect nothing .
