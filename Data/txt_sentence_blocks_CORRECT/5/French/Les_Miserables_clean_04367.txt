You will break those fetters , you will flee . 
That is well . 
You will crawl on your belly through the brushwood , and you will eat grass like the beasts of the forest . 
And you will be recaptured . 
And then you will pass years in a dungeon , riveted to a wall , groping for your jug that you may drink , gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch , eating beans that the worms have eaten before you .
