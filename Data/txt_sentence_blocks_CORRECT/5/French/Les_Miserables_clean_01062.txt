On entering the order of Saint Vincent de Paul , she had taken the name of Simplice by special choice . 
Simplice of Sicily , as we know , is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at Segesta when she had been born at Syracuse -- a lie which would have saved her . 
This patron saint suited this soul . 
Sister Simplice , on her entrance into the order , had had two faults which she had gradually corrected : she had a taste for dainties , and she liked to receive letters . 
She never read anything but a book of prayers printed in Latin , in coarse type .
