Barthelemy , thin , feeble , pale , taciturn , was a sort of tragic street urchin , who , having had his ears boxed by a policeman , lay in wait for him , and killed him , and at seventeen was sent to the galleys . 
He came out and made this barricade . 
Later on , fatal circumstance , in London , proscribed by all , Barthelemy slew Cournet . 
It was a funereal duel . 
Some time afterwards , caught in the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part , a catastrophe in which French justice sees extenuating circumstances , and in which English justice sees only death , Barthelemy was hanged .
