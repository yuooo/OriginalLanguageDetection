listen to me , my prince . 
I do not jest . 
I have a heart , and mind , and soul , and can read your own , - aye , even to its depths . 
I will not take you unready for your task , in order to cast you into the crucible of my own desires , of my caprice , or my ambition . 
Let it be all or nothing .
