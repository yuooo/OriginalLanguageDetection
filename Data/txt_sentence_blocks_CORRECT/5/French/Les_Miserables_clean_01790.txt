Thenardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil , if ruin is possible to zero ; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless scamp would have become a millionaire ; but an inn-keeper must browse where fate has hitched him . 
It will be understood that the word inn-keeper is here employed in a restricted sense , and does not extend to an entire class . 
In this same year , 1823 , Thenardier was burdened with about fifteen hundred francs ' worth of petty debts , and this rendered him anxious . 
Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case , Thenardier was one of those men who understand best , with the most profundity and in the most modern fashion , that thing which is a virtue among barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized peoples , -- hospitality . 
Besides , he was an admirable poacher , and quoted for his skill in shooting .
