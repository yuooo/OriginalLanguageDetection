`` You do not belong in town , sir ? ''

I happen to be going in the direction of the court-house , that is to say , in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture ; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this moment , and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture . '' 
`` Is it there that the Assizes are held ? ''
