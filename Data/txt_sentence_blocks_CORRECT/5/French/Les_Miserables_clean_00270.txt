He seated himself on a wooden bench , with his back against a decrepit vine ; he gazed at the stars , past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit-trees . 
This quarter of an acre , so poorly planted , so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds , was dear to him , and satisfied his wants . 
What more was needed by this old man , who divided the leisure of his life , where there was so little leisure , between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night ? 
Was not this narrow enclosure , with the heavens for a ceiling , sufficient to enable him to adore God in his most divine works , in turn ? 
Does not this comprehend all , in fact ?
