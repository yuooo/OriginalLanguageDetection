Jean Valjean wept for a long time . 
He wept burning tears , he sobbed with more weakness than a woman , with more fright than a child . 
As he wept , daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul ; an extraordinary light ; a light at once ravishing and terrible . 
His past life , his first fault , his long expiation , his external brutishness , his internal hardness , his dismissal to liberty , rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance , what had happened to him at the Bishop 's , the last thing that he had done , that theft of forty sous from a child , a crime all the more cowardly , and all the more monstrous since it had come after the Bishop 's pardon , -- all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him , but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed . 
He examined his life , and it seemed horrible to him ; his soul , and it seemed frightful to him .
