It was Cosette sobbing . 
She had been weeping for more than two hours beside Marius as he meditated . 
He came to her , fell at her knees , and slowly prostrating himself , he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe , and kissed it . 
She let him have his way in silence . 
There are moments when a woman accepts , like a sombre and resigned goddess , the religion of love .
