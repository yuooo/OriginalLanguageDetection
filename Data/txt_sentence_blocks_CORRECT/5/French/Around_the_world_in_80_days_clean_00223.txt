During the journey , the young woman fully recovered her senses . 
What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage , on the railway , dressed in European habiliments , and with travellers who were quite strangers to her ! 
Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor , and then Sir Francis narrated to her what had passed , dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her , and recounting the happy sequel of the venture , the result of Passepartout 's rash idea . 
Mr. Fogg said nothing ; while Passepartout , abashed , kept repeating that `` it was n't worth telling . '' 
Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers , rather with tears than words ; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips .
