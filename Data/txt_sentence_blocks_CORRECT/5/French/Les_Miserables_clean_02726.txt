All that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him back towards the Bishop 's holy injunctions ; Cosette through love , the convent through humility . 
Sometimes at eventide , in the twilight , at an hour when the garden was deserted , he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel , in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival , and turned towards the spot where , as he knew , the sister was making reparation , prostrated in prayer . 
Thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister . 
It seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before God . 
Everything that surrounded him , that peaceful garden , those fragrant flowers , those children who uttered joyous cries , those grave and simple women , that silent cloister , slowly permeated him , and little by little , his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister , of perfume like the flowers , of simplicity like the women , of joy like the children .
