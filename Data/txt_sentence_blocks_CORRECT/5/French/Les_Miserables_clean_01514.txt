An aged and falling apple-tree leans far over to one side , its wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loam . 
Nearly all the apple-trees are falling with age . 
There is not one which has not had its bullet or its biscayan . 
-LSB- 6 -RSB- The skeletons of dead trees abound in this orchard . 
Crows fly through their branches , and at the end of it is a wood full of violets .
