All the mouths which in the morning had shouted , `` Long live the Emperor ! '' 
remain gaping ; they hardly recognize him . 
The Prussian cavalry , newly arrived , dashes forwards , flies , hews , slashes , kills , exterminates . 
Horses lash out , the cannons flee ; the soldiers of the artillery-train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make their escape ; transports overturned , with all four wheels in the air , clog the road and occasion massacres . 
Men are crushed , trampled down , others walk over the dead and the living .
