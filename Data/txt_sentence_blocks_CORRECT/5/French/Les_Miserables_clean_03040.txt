His two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen ; he was serious , it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman . 
He had but one passion -- the right ; but one thought -- to overthrow the obstacle . 
On Mount Aventine , he would have been Gracchus ; in the Convention , he would have been Saint-Just . 
He hardly saw the roses , he ignored spring , he did not hear the carolling of the birds ; the bare throat of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton ; he , like Harmodius , thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword . 
He was severe in his enjoyments .
