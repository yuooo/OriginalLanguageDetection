A gendarme was seated near the door , on the stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D -- the proclamation of the Gulf Juan . 
The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme . 
The gendarme , without replying to his salute , stared attentively at him , followed him for a while with his eyes , and then entered the town-hall . 
There then existed at D -- a fine inn at the sign of the Cross of Colbas . 
This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre , a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another Labarre , who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble , and had served in the Guides .
