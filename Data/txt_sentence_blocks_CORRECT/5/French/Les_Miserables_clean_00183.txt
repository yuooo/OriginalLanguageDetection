This man , after all , this member of the Convention , this representative of the people , had been one of the powerful ones of the earth ; for the first time in his life , probably , the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe . 
Meanwhile , the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality , in which one could have distinguished , possibly , that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust . 
The Bishop , on his side , although he generally restrained his curiosity , which , in his opinion , bordered on a fault , could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which , as it did not have its course in sympathy , would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach , in connection with any other man . 
A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law , even of the law of charity . 
G -- , calm , his body almost upright , his voice vibrating , was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist .
