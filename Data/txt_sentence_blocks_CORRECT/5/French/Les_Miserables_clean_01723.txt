Thenceforth , everything was done on a small scale , instead of on a grand scale ; for lucre instead of the general good . 
There was no longer a centre ; everywhere there was competition and animosity . 
M. Madeleine had reigned over all and directed all . 
No sooner had he fallen , than each pulled things to himself ; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization , bitterness to cordiality , hatred of one another to the benevolence of the founder towards all ; the threads which M. Madeleine had set were tangled and broken , the methods were adulterated , the products were debased , confidence was killed ; the market diminished , for lack of orders ; salaries were reduced , the workshops stood still , bankruptcy arrived . 
And then there was nothing more for the poor .
