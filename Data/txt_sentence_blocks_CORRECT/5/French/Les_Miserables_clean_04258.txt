The whiteness of soul in young girls , which is composed of coldness and gayety , resembles snow . 
It melts in love , which is its sun . 
Cosette did not know what love was . 
She had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense . 
On the books of profane music which entered the convent , amour -LRB- love -RRB- was replaced by tambour -LRB- drum -RRB- or pandour .
