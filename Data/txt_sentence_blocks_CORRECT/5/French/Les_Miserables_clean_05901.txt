The musketry of the besiegers , though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below upwards , was deadly . 
The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain , whence dripped long , red and smoking streams , the uproar was indescribable ; a close and burning smoke almost produced night over this combat . 
Words are lacking to express horror when it has reached this pitch . 
There were no longer men in this conflict , which was now infernal . 
They were no longer giants matched with colossi .
