M. Colbert got into his carriage and the distinguished trio commenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the wood of Vincennes . 
Madame de Chevreuse set down Madame Vanel at her husband 's house , and , left alone with M. Colbert , chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her ride . 
She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation , that dear duchesse , and as she always talked for the ill of others , though ever with a view to her own good , her conversation amused her interlocutor , and did not fail to leave a favorable impression . 
She taught Colbert , who , poor man ! 
was ignorant of the fact , how great a minister he was , and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher .
