`` Well , then , '' added she , `` dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , do not overwhelm me to-day , I again implore you ! 
I am like the branch torn from the trunk , I no longer hold to anything in this world - a current drags me on , I know not whither . 
I love madly , even to the point of coming to tell it , wretch that I am , over the ashes of the dead , and I do not blush for it - I have no remorse on this account . 
Such love is a religion . 
Only , as hereafter you will see me alone , forgotten , disdained ; as you will see me punished , as I am destined to be punished , spare me in my ephemeral happiness , leave it to me for a few days , for a few minutes .
