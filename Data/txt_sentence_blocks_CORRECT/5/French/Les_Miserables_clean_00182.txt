The old man followed him with his eyes , and added , as though speaking to himself : -- `` I shall die while he sleeps . 
The two slumbers may be good neighbors . '' 
The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been . 
He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying ; let us say the whole , for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest : he , who on occasion , was so fond of laughing at `` His Grace , '' was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur , and he was almost tempted to retort `` citizen . '' 
He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity , common enough to doctors and priests , but which was not habitual with him .
