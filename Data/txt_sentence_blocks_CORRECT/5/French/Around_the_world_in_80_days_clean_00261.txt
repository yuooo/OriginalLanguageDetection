Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin , and kept repeating to himself , `` Now , either the warrant will be at Hong Kong , in which case I shall arrest my man , or it will not be there ; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure . 
I have failed at Bombay , and I have failed at Calcutta ; if I fail at Hong Kong , my reputation is lost : Cost what it may , I must succeed ! 
But how shall I prevent his departure , if that should turn out to be my last resource ? '' 
Fix made up his mind that , if worst came to worst , he would make a confidant of Passepartout , and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was . 
That Passepartout was not Fogg 's accomplice , he was very certain .
