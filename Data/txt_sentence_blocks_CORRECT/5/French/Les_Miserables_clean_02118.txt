As eleven o'clock struck from Saint-Etienne-du-Mont , he was traversing the Rue de Pontoise , in front of the office of the commissary of police , situated at No. 14 . 
A few moments later , the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round . 
At that moment he saw distinctly , thanks to the commissary 's lantern , which betrayed them , three men who were following him closely , pass , one after the other , under that lantern , on the dark side of the street . 
One of the three entered the alley leading to the commissary 's house . 
The one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious .
