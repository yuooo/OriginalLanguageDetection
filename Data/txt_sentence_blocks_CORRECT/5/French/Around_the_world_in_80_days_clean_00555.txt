This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians , for more than once they had waylaid trains on the road . 
A hundred of them had , according to their habit , jumped upon the steps without stopping the train , with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop . 
The Sioux were armed with guns , from which came the reports , to which the passengers , who were almost all armed , responded by revolver-shots . 
The Indians had first mounted the engine , and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets . 
A Sioux chief , wishing to stop the train , but not knowing how to work the regulator , had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve , and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity .
