To stand between two religions , from one of which you have not as yet emerged , and another into which you have not yet entered , is intolerable ; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls . 
Marius was clear-eyed , and he required the true light . 
The half-lights of doubt pained him . 
Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was , he could not halt there , he was irresistibly constrained to continue , to advance , to examine , to think , to march further . 
Whither would this lead him ?
