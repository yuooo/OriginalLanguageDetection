Louis Philippe was a rare man . 
The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating circumstances , but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of blame ; possessing all private virtues and many public virtues ; careful of his health , of his fortune , of his person , of his affairs , knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year ; sober , serene , peaceable , patient ; a good man and a good prince ; sleeping with his wife , and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois , an ostentation of the regular sleeping-apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch ; knowing all the languages of Europe , and , what is more rare , all the languages of all interests , and speaking them ; an admirable representative of the `` middle class , '' but outstripping it , and in every way greater than it ; possessing excellent sense , while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung , counting most of all on his intrinsic worth , and , on the question of his race , very particular , declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon ; thoroughly the first Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene Highness , but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king ; diffuse in public , concise in private ; reputed , but not proved to be a miser ; at bottom , one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty ; lettered , but not very sensitive to letters ; a gentleman , but not a chevalier ; simple , calm , and strong ; adored by his family and his household ; a fascinating talker , an undeceived statesman , inwardly cold , dominated by immediate interest , always governing at the shortest range , incapable of rancor and of gratitude , making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity , clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under thrones ; unreserved , sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve , but with marvellous address in that imprudence ; fertile in expedients , in countenances , in masks ; making France fear Europe and Europe France ! 
Incontestably fond of his country , but preferring his family ; assuming more domination than authority and more authority than dignity , a disposition which has this unfortunate property , that as it turns everything to success , it admits of ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness , but which has this valuable side , that it preserves politics from violent shocks , the state from fractures , and society from catastrophes ; minute , correct , vigilant , attentive , sagacious , indefatigable ; contradicting himself at times and giving himself the lie ; bold against Austria at Ancona , obstinate against England in Spain , bombarding Antwerp , and paying off Pritchard ; singing the Marseillaise with conviction , inaccessible to despondency , to lassitude , to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal , to daring generosity , to Utopia , to chimeras , to wrath , to vanity , to fear ; possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity ; a general at Valmy ; a soldier at Jemappes ; attacked eight times by regicides and always smiling . 
brave as a grenadier , courageous as a thinker ; uneasy only in the face of the chances of a European shaking up , and unfitted for great political adventures ; always ready to risk his life , never his work ; disguising his will in influence , in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king ; endowed with observation and not with divination ; not very attentive to minds , but knowing men , that is to say requiring to see in order to judge ; prompt and penetrating good sense , practical wisdom , easy speech , prodigious memory ; drawing incessantly on this memory , his only point of resemblance with Caesar , Alexander , and Napoleon ; knowing deeds , facts , details , dates , proper names , ignorant of tendencies , passions , the diverse geniuses of the crowd , the interior aspirations , the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls , in a word , all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences ; accepted by the surface , but little in accord with France lower down ; extricating himself by dint of tact ; governing too much and not enough ; his own first minister ; excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas ; mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization , of order and organization , an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery , the founder and lawyer of a dynasty ; having something of Charlemagne and something of an attorney ; in short , a lofty and original figure , a prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of France , and power in spite of the jealousy of Europe . 
Louis Philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century , and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little , and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful .
