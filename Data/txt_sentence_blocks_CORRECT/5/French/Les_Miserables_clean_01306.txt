He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall , and which contained , under glass , an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas Pache , mayor of Paris and minister , and dated , through an error , no doubt , the 9th of June , of the year II. , and in which Pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them . 
Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment , and who had watched him , would have imagined , doubtless , that this letter struck him as very curious , for he did not take his eyes from it , and he read it two or three times . 
He read it without paying any attention to it , and unconsciously . 
He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette . 
As he dreamed , he turned round , and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes .
