And , going up to the elephant , he gave him several lumps of sugar , saying , `` Here , Kiouni , here , here . '' 
The elephant grunted out his satisfaction , and , clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk , lifted him as high as his head . 
Passepartout , not in the least alarmed , caressed the animal , which replaced him gently on the ground . 
Soon after , Phileas Fogg , Sir Francis Cromarty , and Passepartout , installed in a carriage with Aouda , who had the best seat , were whirling at full speed towards Benares . 
It was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours .
