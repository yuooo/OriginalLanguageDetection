You knew that the way -- '' `` Not at all ; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route . 
Nothing , therefore , is lost . 
I have two days , which I have already gained , to sacrifice . 
A steamer leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon , on the 25th . 
This is the 22nd , and we shall reach Calcutta in time . ''
