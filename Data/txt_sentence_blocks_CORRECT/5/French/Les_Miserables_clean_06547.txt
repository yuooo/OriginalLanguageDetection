He was as motionless as a corpse , while his thoughts wallowed on the earth and soared , now like the hydra , now like the eagle . 
Any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead ; all at once he shuddered convulsively , and his mouth , glued to Cosette 's garments , kissed them ; then it could be seen that he was alive . 
Who could see ? 
Since Jean Valjean was alone , and there was no one there . 
The One who is in the shadows .
