How did those children come there ? 
Perhaps they had escaped from some guard-house which stood ajar ; perhaps there was in the vicinity , at the Barriere d'Enfer ; or on the Esplanade de l'Observatoire , or in the neighboring carrefour , dominated by the pediment on which could be read : Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum , some mountebank 's booth from which they had fled ; perhaps they had , on the preceding evening , escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing , and had passed the night in some one of those sentry-boxes where people read the papers ? 
The fact is , they were stray lambs and they seemed free . 
To be astray and to seem free is to be lost . 
These poor little creatures were , in fact , lost .
