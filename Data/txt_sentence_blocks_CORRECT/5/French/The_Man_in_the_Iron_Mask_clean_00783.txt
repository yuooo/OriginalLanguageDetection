Philippe , sole heir presumptive to Louis XIII. , your father , show yourself without pity or mercy for the usurper who , at this moment , has not even to suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you have had to submit to . '' 
With these words , Philippe , notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of feeling , and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will , threw himself on the royal bed , and forced his muscles to press the still warm place where Louis XIV . 
had lain , while he buried his burning face in the handkerchief still moistened by his brother 's tears . 
With his head thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow , Philippe perceived above him the crown of France , suspended , as we have stated , by angels with outspread golden wings . 
A man may be ambitious of lying in a lion 's den , but can hardly hope to sleep there quietly .
