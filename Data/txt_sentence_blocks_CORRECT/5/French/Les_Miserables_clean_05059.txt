Nothing is , generally , more singularly calm than the physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious quarters . 
Paris very speedily accustoms herself to anything , -- it is only a riot , -- and Paris has so many affairs on hand , that she does not put herself out for so small a matter . 
These colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles . 
These immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity . 
Ordinarily , when an insurrection commences , when the shop-keeper hears the drum , the call to arms , the general alarm , he contents himself with the remark : -- `` There appears to be a squabble in the Rue Saint-Martin . ''
