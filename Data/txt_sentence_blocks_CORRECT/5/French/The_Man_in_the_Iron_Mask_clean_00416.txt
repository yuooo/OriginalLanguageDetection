`` Monseigneur , '' resumed Aramis , `` you know the history of the government which to-day controls France . 
The king issued from an infancy imprisoned like yours , obscure as yours , and confined as yours ; only , instead of ending , like yourself , this slavery in a prison , this obscurity in solitude , these straightened circumstances in concealment , he was fain to bear all these miseries , humiliations , and distresses , in full daylight , under the pitiless sun of royalty ; on an elevation flooded with light , where every stain appears a blemish , every glory a stain . 
The king has suffered ; it rankles in his mind ; and he will avenge himself . 
He will be a bad king . 
I say not that he will pour out his people 's blood , like Louis XI. , or Charles IX. ; for he has no mortal injuries to avenge ; but he will devour the means and substance of his people ; for he has himself undergone wrongs in his own interest and money .
