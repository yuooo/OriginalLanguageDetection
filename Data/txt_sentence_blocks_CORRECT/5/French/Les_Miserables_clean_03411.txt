Montparnasse was a child ; less than twenty years of age , with a handsome face , lips like cherries , charming black hair , the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes ; he had all vices and aspired to all crimes . 
The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse . 
It was the street boy turned pickpocket , and a pickpocket turned garroter . 
He was genteel , effeminate , graceful , robust , sluggish , ferocious . 
The rim of his hat was curled up on the left side , in order to make room for a tuft of hair , after the style of 1829 .
