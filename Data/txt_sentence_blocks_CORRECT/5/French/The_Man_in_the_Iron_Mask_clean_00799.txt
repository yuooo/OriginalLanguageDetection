This morning , when I got up , I remarked that my sword had got caught in one of the aiguillettes , and that my shoulder-belt had slipped quite off . 
That is an infallible sign . '' 
`` Of prosperity ? '' 
`` Yes , be sure of it ; for every time that that confounded belt of mine stuck fast to my back , it always signified a punishment from M. de Treville , or a refusal of money by M. de Mazarin . 
Every time my sword hung fast to my shoulder-belt , it always predicted some disagreeable commission or another for me to execute , and I have had showers of them all my life through .
