`` To recommence the combat , '' said Aramis , `` is hazardous . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Porthos , `` for it is difficult to suppose that out of two , one should not be killed ; and certainly , if one of us was killed , the other would get himself killed also . '' 
Porthos spoke these words with that heroic nature which , with him , grew grander with necessity . 
Aramis felt it like a spur to his heart . 
`` We shall neither of us be killed if you do what I tell you , friend Porthos . ''
