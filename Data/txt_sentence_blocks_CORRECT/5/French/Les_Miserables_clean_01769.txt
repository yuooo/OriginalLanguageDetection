We find in them a quantity of small seed which we can not sift out , and which we are obliged to send through the mill-stones ; there are tares , fennel , vetches , hempseed , fox-tail , and a host of other weeds , not to mention pebbles , which abound in certain wheat , especially in Breton wheat . 
I am not fond of grinding Breton wheat , any more than long-sawyers like to saw beams with nails in them . 
You can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding . 
And then people complain of the flour . 
They are in the wrong .
