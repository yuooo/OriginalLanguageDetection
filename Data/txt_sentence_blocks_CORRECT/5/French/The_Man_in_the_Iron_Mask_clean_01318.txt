`` I have not been a friend for you , Raoul , '' said Athos . 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur , and in what respect not ? '' 
`` Because I have given you reason to think that life has but one face , because , sad and severe , alas ! 
I have always cut off for you , without , God knows , wishing to do so , the joyous buds that spring incessantly from the fair tree of youth ; so that at this moment I repent of not having made of you a more expansive , dissipated , animated man . ''
