Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action , in addition to the glory which we just mentioned , and of which he knew nothing ; in the first place it made him happy ; next , he had much less work , since it was shared . 
Lastly , as he was very fond of snuff , he found the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage , in that he used three times as much as he had done previously , and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner , seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it . 
The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime ; they called Jean Valjean the other Fauvent . 
If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert 's glance , they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the behalf of the garden , it was always the elder Fauchelevent , the old , the infirm , the lame man , who went , and never the other ; but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on God know not how to spy , or whether they were , by preference , occupied in keeping watch on each other , they paid no heed to this . 
Moreover , it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did not stir out .
