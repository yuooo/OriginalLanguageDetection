Had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef , could no longer divine the snare , no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses ? 
Had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes ? 
He who had in former days known all the roads to triumph , and who , from the summit of his chariot of lightning , pointed them out with a sovereign finger , had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it , to the precipice ? 
Was he seized at the age of forty-six with a supreme madness ? 
Was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longer anything more than an immense dare-devil ?
