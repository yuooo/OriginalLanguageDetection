The clerk introduced him into the commissary 's office . 
There stood a tall man behind a grating , leaning against a stove , and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat , with three collars . 
His face was square , with a thin , firmmouth , thick , gray , and very ferocious whiskers , and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out . 
Of that glance it might have been well said , not that it penetrated , but that it searched . 
This man 's air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than Jondrette 's ; the dog is , at times , no less terrible to meet than the wolf .
