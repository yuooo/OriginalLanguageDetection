Suddenly , the chill of the dungeons seemed to fall like a wet cloak upon Louis 's shoulders . 
`` I have seen , '' he said , `` my father lying dead upon his funeral couch , in his regal robes . 
That pale face , so calm and worn ; those hands , once so skillful , lying nerveless by his side ; those limbs stiffened by the icy grasp of death ; nothing there betokened a sleep that was disturbed by dreams . 
And yet , how numerous were the dreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse - him whom so many others had preceded , hurried away by him into eternal death ! 
No , that king was still the king : he was enthroned still upon that funeral couch , as upon a velvet armchair ; he had not abdicated one title of his majesty .
