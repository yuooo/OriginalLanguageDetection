Aramis thereupon turned towards him , and said , in a quiet tone , `` You will not forget , my friend , the king 's order respecting those whom he intends to receive this morning on rising . '' 
These words were clear enough , and the musketeer understood them ; he therefore bowed to Fouquet , and then to Aramis , - to the latter with a slight admixture of ironical respect , - and disappeared . 
No sooner had he left , than Fouquet , whose impatience had hardly been able to wait for that moment , darted towards the door to close it , and then returning to the bishop , he said , `` My dear D'Herblay , I think it now high time you should explain all that has passed , for , in plain and honest truth , I do not understand anything . '' 
`` We will explain all that to you , '' said Aramis , sitting down , and making Fouquet sit down also . 
`` Where shall I begin ? ''
