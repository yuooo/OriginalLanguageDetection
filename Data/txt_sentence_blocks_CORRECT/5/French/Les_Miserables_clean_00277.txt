The universe appeared to him like an immense malady ; everywhere he felt fever , everywhere he heard the sound of suffering , and , without seeking to solve the enigma , he strove to dress the wound . 
The terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him ; he was occupied only in finding for himself , and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve . 
That which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation . 
There are men who toil at extracting gold ; he toiled at the extraction of pity . 
Universal misery was his mine .
