AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PASSEPARTOUT ACCEPT EACH OTHER , THE ONE AS MASTER , THE OTHER AS MAN Mr. Phileas Fogg lived , in 1872 , at No. 7 , Saville Row , Burlington Gardens , the house in which Sheridan died in 1814 . 
He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world . 
People said that he resembled Byron -- at least that his head was Byronic ; but he was a bearded , tranquil Byron , who might live on a thousand years without growing old . 
Certainly an Englishman , it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner . 
He was never seen on ` Change , nor at the Bank , nor in the counting-rooms of the `` City '' ; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner ; he had no public employment ; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court , either at the Temple , or Lincoln 's Inn , or Gray 's Inn ; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery , or in the Exchequer , or the Queen 's Bench , or the Ecclesiastical Courts .
