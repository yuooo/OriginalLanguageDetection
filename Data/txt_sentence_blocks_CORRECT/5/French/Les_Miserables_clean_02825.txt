He had two servants , `` a male and a female . '' 
When a servant entered his establishment , M. Gillenormand re-baptized him . 
He bestowed on the men the name of their province : Nimois , Comtois , Poitevin , Picard . 
His last valet was a big , foundered , short-winded fellow of fifty-five , who was incapable of running twenty paces ; but , as he had been born at Bayonne , M. Gillenormand called him Basque . 
All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette -LRB- even the Magnon , of whom we shall hear more farther on -RRB- .
