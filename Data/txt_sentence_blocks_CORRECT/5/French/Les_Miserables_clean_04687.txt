It is a whole language within a language , a sort of sickly excrescence , an unhealthy graft which has produced a vegetation , a parasite which has its roots in the old Gallic trunk , and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side of the language . 
This is what may be called the first , the vulgar aspect of slang . 
But , for those who study the tongue as it should be studied , that is to say , as geologists study the earth , slang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit . 
According as one digs a longer or shorter distance into it , one finds in slang , below the old popular French , Provencal , Spanish , Italian , Levantine , that language of the Mediterranean ports , English and German , the Romance language in its three varieties , French , Italian , and Romance Romance , Latin , and finally Basque and Celtic . 
A profound and unique formation .
