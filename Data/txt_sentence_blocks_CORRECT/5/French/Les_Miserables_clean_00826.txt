This man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments , comparatively ; but he rendered them almost bad , by dint of exaggerating them , -- respect for authority , hatred of rebellion ; and in his eyes , murder , robbery , all crimes , are only forms of rebellion . 
He enveloped in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state , from the prime minister to the rural policeman . 
He covered with scorn , aversion , and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil . 
He was absolute , and admitted no exceptions . 
On the one hand , he said , `` The functionary can make no mistake ; the magistrate is never the wrong . ''
