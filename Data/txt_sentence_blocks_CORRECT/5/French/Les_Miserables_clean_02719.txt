On the one hand , confidences over crimes , which are exchanged in whispers ; on the other , the confession of faults made aloud . 
And what crimes ! 
And what faults ! 
On the one hand , miasms ; on the other , an ineffable perfume . 
On the one hand , a moral pest , guarded from sight , penned up under the range of cannon , and literally devouring its plague-stricken victims ; on the other , the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth .
