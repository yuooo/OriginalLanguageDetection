At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station , and found the train ready to depart . 
As he was about to enter it , Mr. Fogg called a porter , and said to him : `` My friend , was there not some trouble to-day in San Francisco ? '' 
`` It was a political meeting , sir , '' replied the porter . 
`` But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets . '' 
`` It was only a meeting assembled for an election . ''
