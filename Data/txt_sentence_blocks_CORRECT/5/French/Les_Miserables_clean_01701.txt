Terrible entanglement ! 
There was no longer any slope , for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain , and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley . 
A heap of dead bodies in the upper part , a river of blood in the lower part -- such was that road on the evening of the 18th of June , 1815 . 
The blood ran even to the Nivelles highway , and there overflowed in a large pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way , at a spot which is still pointed out . 
It will be remembered that it was at the opposite point , in the direction of the Genappe road , that the destruction of the cuirassiers had taken place .
