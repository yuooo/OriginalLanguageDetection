In front of the sixth are placed two English tombs of granite . 
There are loopholes only in the south wall , as the principal attack came from that quarter . 
The wall is hidden on the outside by a tall hedge ; the French came up , thinking that they had to deal only with a hedge , crossed it , and found the wall both an obstacle and an ambuscade , with the English guards behind it , the thirty-eight loopholes firing at once a shower of grape-shot and balls , and Soye 's brigade was broken against it . 
Thus Waterloo began . 
Nevertheless , the orchard was taken .
