All night long she saw that big stone , as large as a mountain and full of caverns . 
At sunrise , -- the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the past night , and our laughter is in direct proportion to our terror which they have caused , -- at sunrise Cosette , when she woke , viewed her fright as a nightmare , and said to herself : `` What have I been thinking of ? 
It is like the footsteps that I thought I heard a week or two ago in the garden at night ! 
It is like the shadow of the chimney-pot ! 
Am I becoming a coward ? ''
