No one is a good historian of the patent , visible , striking , and public life of peoples , if he is not , at the same time , in a certain measure , the historian of their deep and hidden life ; and no one is a good historian of the interior unless he understands how , at need , to be the historian of the exterior also . 
The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events , and this is true reciprocally . 
They constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other , which are always interlaced , and which often bring forth results . 
All the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels , sombre but distinct , in their depths , and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface . 
True history being a mixture of all things , the true historian mingles in everything .
