Upon this spot , and for this duel , on the 18th of June , Wellington had the good post , Napoleon the bad post . 
The English army was stationed above , the French army below . 
It is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon on horseback , glass in hand , upon the heights of Rossomme , at daybreak , on June 18 , 1815 . 
All the world has seen him before we can show him . 
That calm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school of Brienne , that green uniform , the white revers concealing the star of the Legion of Honor , his great coat hiding his epaulets , the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his vest , his leather trousers , the white horse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners crowned N 's and eagles , Hessian boots over silk stockings , silver spurs , the sword of Marengo , -- that whole figure of the last of the Caesars is present to all imaginations , saluted with acclamations by some , severely regarded by others .
