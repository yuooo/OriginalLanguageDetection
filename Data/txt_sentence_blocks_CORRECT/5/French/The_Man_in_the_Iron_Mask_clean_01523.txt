`` Ah ! 
monseigneur , a regular prison ! 
The absence of M. de Gesvres , who has the honor of being one of your friends . 
The closing of the gates of the city , and of the river without a pass ; but , only when the king shall have arrived . 
Please to observe , Monsieur Fouquet , that if , instead of speaking to man like you , who are one of the first in the kingdom , I were speaking to a troubled , uneasy conscience - I should compromise myself forever .
