Every morning I went through military exercises , and practiced on horseback . 
Well , one morning during the summer , it being very hot , I went to sleep in the hall . 
Nothing , up to that period , except the respect paid me , had enlightened me , or even roused my suspicions . 
I lived as children , as birds , as plants , as the air and the sun do . 
I had just turned my fifteenth year - '' `` This , then , is eight years ago ? ''
