The `` malefactor '' who had been there was Father Madeleine . 
He was affable and sad . 
The people said : `` There is a rich man who has not a haughty air . 
There is a happy man who has not a contented air . '' 
Some people maintained that he was a mysterious person , and that no one ever entered his chamber , which was a regular anchorite 's cell , furnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and skulls of dead men !
