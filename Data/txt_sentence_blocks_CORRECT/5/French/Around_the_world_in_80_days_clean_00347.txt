I have missed the Carnatic , and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest , to take the boat for San Francisco . '' 
`` I am sorry , '' said the sailor ; `` but it is impossible . '' 
`` I offer you a hundred pounds per day , and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time . ''
