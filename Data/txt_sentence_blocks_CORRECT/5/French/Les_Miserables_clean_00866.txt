An old gossip was found , who made the trip to Montfermeil , talked to the Thenardiers , and said on her return : `` For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind . 
I have seen the child . '' 
The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien , the guardian and door-keeper of every one 's virtue . 
Madame Victurnien was fifty-six , and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age . 
A quavering voice , a whimsical mind .
