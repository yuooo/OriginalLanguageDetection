Manage so that , when you are with each other , nothing shall be lacking to you , and that Cosette may be the sun for Marius , and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette . 
Cosette , let your fine weather be the smile of your husband ; Marius , let your rain be your wife 's tears . 
And let it never rain in your household . 
You have filched the winning number in the lottery ; you have gained the great prize , guard it well , keep it under lock and key , do not squander it , adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest . 
Believe what I say to you .
