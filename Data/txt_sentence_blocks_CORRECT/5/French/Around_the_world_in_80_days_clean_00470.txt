Passepartout was waiting for his master , armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers . 
When he perceived Fix , he knit his brows ; but Aouda having , in a few words , told him of their adventure , his countenance resumed its placid expression .

As he was getting in , Mr. Fogg said to Fix , `` You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again ? ''
