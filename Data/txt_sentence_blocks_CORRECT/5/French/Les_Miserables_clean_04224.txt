Her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds , spiders , and serpents . 
When she meditated in the evening , before falling asleep , as she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean 's daughter , and that he was her father , she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her . 
When he was seated , she leaned her cheek against his white hair , and dropped a silent tear , saying to herself : `` Perhaps this man is my mother . '' 
Cosette , although this is a strange statement to make , in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent , -- maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity , -- had ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible . 
She did not even know her mother 's name .
