Thirty years ago , at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of June , it was still , in many localities , nearly the same ancient sewer . 
A very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways . 
At the end of a slope , where the tributaries of a street or cross-roads ended , there were often to be seen large , square gratings with heavy bars , whose iron , polished by the footsteps of the throng , gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles , and caused horses to fall . 
The official language of the Roads and Bridges gave to these gratings the expressive name of Cassis .
