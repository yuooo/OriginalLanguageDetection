There , she became a little girl once more , she could run and almost play ; she took off her hat , laid it on Jean Valjean 's knees , and gathered bunches of flowers . 
She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers , but did not catch them ; gentleness and tenderness are born with love , and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly . 
She wove garlands of poppies , which she placed on her head , and which , crossed and penetrated with sunlight , glowing until they flamed , formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers . 
Even after their life had grown sad , they kept up their custom of early strolls . 
One morning in October , therefore , tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn of 1831 , they set out , and found themselves at break of day near the Barriere du Maine .
