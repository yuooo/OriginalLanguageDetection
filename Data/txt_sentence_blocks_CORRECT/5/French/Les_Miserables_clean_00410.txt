As might have been observed from what has been said above , the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated , or to get out of it , it was necessary to traverse the Bishop 's bedroom . 
At the moment when he was crossing this apartment , Madame Magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed . 
This was her last care every evening before she went to bed . 
The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove . 
A fresh white bed had been prepared there .
