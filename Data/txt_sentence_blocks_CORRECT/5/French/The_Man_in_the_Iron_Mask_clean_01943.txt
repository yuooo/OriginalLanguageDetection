We have said that the light produced by the spark and the match did not last more than two seconds ; but during these two seconds this is what it illumined : in the first place , the giant , enlarged in the darkness ; then , at ten paces off , a heap of bleeding bodies , crushed , mutilated , in the midst of which some still heaved in the last agony , lifting the mass as a last respiration inflating the sides of some old monster dying in the night . 
Every breath of Porthos , thus vivifying the match , sent towards this heap of bodies a phosphorescent aura , mingled with streaks of purple . 
In addition to this principal group scattered about the grotto , as the chances of death or surprise had stretched them , isolated bodies seemed to be making ghastly exhibitions of their gaping wounds . 
Above ground , bedded in pools of blood , rose , heavy and sparkling , the short , thick pillars of the cavern , of which the strongly marked shades threw out the luminous particles . 
And all this was seen by the tremulous light of a match attached to a barrel of powder , that is to say , a torch which , whilst throwing a light on the dead past , showed death to come .
