Was she handsome ? 
Perhaps ; but in that attire it was not apparent . 
Her hair , a golden lock of which had escaped , seemed very thick , but was severely concealed beneath an ugly , tight , close , nun-like cap , tied under the chin . 
A smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them ; but she did not smile . 
Her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time .
