The ground-floor of Number 50-52 , a sort of dilapidated penthouse , served as a wagon-house for market-gardeners , and no communication existed between it and the first story . 
It was separated by the flooring , which had neither traps nor stairs , and which formed the diaphragm of the building , as it were . 
The first story contained , as we have said , numerous chambers and several attics , only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean 's housekeeping ; all the rest was uninhabited . 
It was this old woman , ornamented with the name of the principal lodger , and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress , who had let him the lodging on Christmas eve . 
He had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds , who was coming there to live with his little daughter .
