If any light had illuminated that man , it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain . 
Arrived beneath the elephant , he uttered a peculiar cry , which did not belong to any human tongue , and which a paroquet alone could have imitated . 
Twice he repeated this cry , of whose orthography the following barely conveys an idea : -- `` Kirikikiou ! '' 
At the second cry , a clear , young , merry voice responded from the belly of the elephant : -- `` Yes ! '' 
Almost immediately , the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside , and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant 's leg , and fell briskly near the man .
