During this colloquy , which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes , some one , a stranger , came and placed himself behind the hearse , beside Fauchelevent . 
He was a sort of laboring man , who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm . 
Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
he demanded .
