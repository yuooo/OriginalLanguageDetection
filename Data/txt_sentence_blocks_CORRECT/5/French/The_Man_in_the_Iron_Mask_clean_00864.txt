`` I mean , my friend , '' returned Aramis , with the same intonation on the word friend that he had applied to it the first time - `` I mean that if there has been any confusion , scandal , and even effort in the substitution of the prisoner for the king , I defy you to prove it . '' 
`` What ! '' 
cried Fouquet , whiter than the handkerchief with which he wiped his temples , `` what do you say ? '' 
`` Go to the king 's apartment , '' continued Aramis , tranquilly , `` and you who know the mystery , I defy even you to perceive that the prisoner of the Bastile is lying in his brother 's bed . ''
