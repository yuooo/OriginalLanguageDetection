The Polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend . 
The goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer ; the corpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la Barillerie ; Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the great hiatus of the sewer of the Marais , which remained yawning until 1833 in the Rue Saint-Louis , almost opposite the sign of the Gallant Messenger . 
The mouth of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which had their source there ; with its grating of iron , with points simulating a row of teeth , it was like a dragon 's maw in that fatal street , breathing forth hell upon men . 
The popular imagination seasoned the sombre Parisian sink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite . 
The sewer had no bottom .
