`` Yes , there is a bark in the creek , which is prudently seeking shelter here ; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at all -- it has run aground . '' 
`` Yes , yes , I see it . '' 
`` It is the carriage , which I threw into the sea after landing the prisoner . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
said Athos , `` if you take my advice , D'Artagnan , you will burn that carriage , in order that no vestige of it may remain , without which the fishermen of Antibes , who have believed they had to do with the devil , will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man . ''
