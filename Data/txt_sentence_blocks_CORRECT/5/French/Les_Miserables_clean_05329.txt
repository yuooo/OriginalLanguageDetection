He beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him , and into this he was about to fall . 
Then he shuddered . 
He thought of his father 's sword , which his grandfather had sold to a second-hand dealer , and which he had so mournfully regretted . 
He said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from him , and to depart in wrath into the gloom ; that if it had thus fled , it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future ; that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion , the war of the gutters , the war of the pavements , fusillades through cellar-windows , blows given and received in the rear ; it was because , coming from Marengo and Friedland , it did not wish to go to the Rue de la Chanvrerie ; it was because , after what it had done with the father , it did not wish to do this for the son ! 
He told himself that if that sword were there , if after taking possession of it at his father 's pillow , he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness between Frenchmen in the streets , it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes , like the sword of the angel !
