And he remembered that he had dared to murmur ! 
Often , in the middle of the night , he rose to listen to the grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities , and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy , and that he , wretch that he was , had shaken his fist at God . 
There was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply , like a warning whisper from Providence itself : the scaling of that wall , the passing of those barriers , the adventure accepted even at the risk of death , the painful and difficult ascent , all those efforts even , which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation , he had made in order to gain entrance into this one . 
Was this a symbol of his destiny ? 
This house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled , and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar .
