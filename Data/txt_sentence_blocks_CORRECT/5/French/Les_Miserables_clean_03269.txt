Towards the middle of this year 1831 , the old woman who waited on Marius told him that his neighbors , the wretched Jondrette family , had been turned out of doors . 
Marius , who passed nearly the whole of his days out of the house , hardly knew that he had any neighbors . 
`` Why are they turned out ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Because they do not pay their rent ; they owe for two quarters . ''
