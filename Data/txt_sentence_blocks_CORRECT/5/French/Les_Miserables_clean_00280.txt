He might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old . 
A cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face , burned and tanned by sun and wind , and dripping with perspiration . 
His shirt of coarse yellow linen , fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor , permitted a view of his hairy breast : he had a cravat twisted into a string ; trousers of blue drilling , worn and threadbare , white on one knee and torn on the other ; an old gray , tattered blouse , patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine ; a tightly packed soldier knapsack , well buckled and perfectly new , on his back ; an enormous , knotty stick in his hand ; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet ; a shaved head and a long beard . 
The sweat , the heat , the journey on foot , the dust , added I know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole . 
His hair was closely cut , yet bristling , for it had begun to grow a little , and did not seem to have been cut for some time .
