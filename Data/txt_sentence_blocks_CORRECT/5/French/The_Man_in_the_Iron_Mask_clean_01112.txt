Athos gave this worthy servant orders to take the route to Paris when the equipments should be ready ; and , not to expose himself to the danger of keeping the duke waiting , or delaying Raoul , so that the duke should perceive his absence , he himself , the day after the visit of M. de Beaufort , set off for Paris with his son .

Raoul , on approaching Paris , felt as if he were dying .
