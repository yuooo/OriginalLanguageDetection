I was a beggar and thou wert charitable . 
I kissed thy fresh round arms in haste . 
A folio Dante served us as a table on which to eat merrily a centime 's worth of chestnuts . 
The first time that , in my joyous den , I snatched a kiss from thy fiery lip , when thou wentest forth , dishevelled and blushing , I turned deathly pale and I believed in God . 
Dost thou recall our innumerable joys , and all those fichus changed to rags ?
