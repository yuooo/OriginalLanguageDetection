How comes it to pass that the birds sing , that snow melts , that the rose unfolds , that May expands , that the dawn grows white behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills ? 
A kiss , and that was all . 
Both started , and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes . 
They felt neither the cool night , nor the cold stone , nor the damp earth , nor the wet grass ; they looked at each other , and their hearts were full of thoughts . 
They had clasped hands unconsciously .
