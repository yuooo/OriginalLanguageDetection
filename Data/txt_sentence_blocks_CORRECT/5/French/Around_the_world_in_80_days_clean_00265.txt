Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities , and signal the Rangoon before her arrival . 
This was easy to do , since the steamer stopped at Singapore , whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong . 
He finally resolved , moreover , before acting more positively , to question Passepartout . 
It would not be difficult to make him talk ; and , as there was no time to lose , Fix prepared to make himself known . 
It was now the 30th of October , and on the following day the Rangoon was due at Singapore .
