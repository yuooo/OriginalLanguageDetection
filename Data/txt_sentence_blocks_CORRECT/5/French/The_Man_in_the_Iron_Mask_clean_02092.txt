The courts were deserted - the stables closed - the parterres neglected . 
In the basins , the fountains , formerly so jubilantly fresh and noisy , had stopped of themselves . 
Along the roads around the chateau came a few grave personages mounted on mules or country nags . 
These were rural neighbors , cures and bailiffs of adjacent estates . 
All these people entered the chateau silently , handed their horses to a melancholy-looking groom , and directed their steps , conducted by a huntsman in black , to the great dining-room , where Mousqueton received them at the door .
