As repression has the army , it does not count its men , and , as it has Vincennes , it does not count its shots . 
Repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men , and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes . 
Thus they are struggles of one against a hundred , which always end in crushing the barricade ; unless the revolution , uprising suddenly , flings into the balance its flaming archangel 's sword . 
This does happen sometimes . 
Then everything rises , the pavements begin to seethe , popular redoubts abound .
