For me , the result of your words is , that the day you desire to hurl down the man you shall have raised , the event will be accomplished ; and that you will keep under your hand your creation of yesterday . '' 
`` Undeceive yourself , monseigneur , '' replied the bishop . 
`` I should not take the trouble to play this terrible game with your royal highness , if I had not a double interest in gaining it . 
The day you are elevated , you are elevated forever ; you will overturn the footstool , as you rise , and will send it rolling so far , that not even the sight of it will ever again recall to you its right to simple gratitude . ''
