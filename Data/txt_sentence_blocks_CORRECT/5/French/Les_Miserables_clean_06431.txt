They even bestride the carriage lamps . 
They stand , sit , lie , with their knees drawn up in a knot , and their legs hanging . 
The women sit on the men 's laps . 
Far away , above the throng of heads , their wild pyramid is visible . 
These carriage-loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout .
