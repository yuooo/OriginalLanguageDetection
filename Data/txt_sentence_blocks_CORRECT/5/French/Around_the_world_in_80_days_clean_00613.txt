The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important Nebraska town . 
Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad , which runs directly east , and passes fifty stations . 
A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached the station , and they only had time to get into the cars . 
They had seen nothing of Omaha ; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this was not to be regretted , as they were not travelling to see the sights . 
The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa , by Council Bluffs , Des Moines , and Iowa City .
