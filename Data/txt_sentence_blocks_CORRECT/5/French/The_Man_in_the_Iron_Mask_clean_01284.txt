It is said that happy lovers are deaf to the sorrows of rejected lovers . 
It will not be so with you , who did not love me , save with anxiety . 
I am sure that if I had persisted in endeavoring to change that friendship into love , you would have yielded out of a fear of bringing about my death , or lessening the esteem I had for you . 
It is much more delightful to me to die , knowing that you are free and satisfied . 
How much , then , will you love me , when you will no longer fear either my presence or reproaches ?
