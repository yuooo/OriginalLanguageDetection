Nothing could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young prince at the moment Fouquet had surprised him ; his clothes were in tatters ; his shirt , open and torn to rags , was stained with sweat and with the blood which streamed from his lacerated breast and arms . 
Haggard , ghastly pale , his hair in disheveled masses , Louis XIV . 
presented the most perfect picture of despair , distress , anger and fear combined that could possibly be united in one figure . 
Fouquet was so touched , so affected and disturbed by it , that he ran towards him with his arms stretched out and his eyes filled with tears .
