There , near a factory , and between two garden walls , there could be seen , at that epoch , a mean building , which , at the first glance , seemed as small as a thatched hovel , and which was , in reality , as large as a cathedral . 
It presented its side and gable to the public road ; hence its apparent diminutiveness . 
Nearly the whole of the house was hidden . 
Only the door and one window could be seen . 
This hovel was only one story high .
