As she rocked her little ones , the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated : -- `` It must be , said a warrior . '' 
Her song , and the contemplation of her daughters , prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street . 
In the meantime , some one had approached her , as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance , and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear : -- `` You have two beautiful children there , Madame . '' 
`` To the fair and tender Imogene -- '' replied the mother , continuing her romance ; then she turned her head . 
A woman stood before her , a few paces distant .
