When Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his master 's bell , Mr. Fogg , not betraying the least vexation , contented himself with taking his carpet-bag , calling Aouda , and sending for a palanquin . 
It was then eight o'clock ; at half-past nine , it being then high tide , the Carnatic would leave the harbour . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin , their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow , and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark . 
Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before . 
He had expected to find not only the steamer , but his domestic , and was forced to give up both ; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face , and he merely remarked to Aouda , `` It is an accident , madam ; nothing more . ''
