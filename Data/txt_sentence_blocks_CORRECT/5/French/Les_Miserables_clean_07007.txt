That stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy of time , of dampness , of the lichens and from the defilement of the birds . 
The water turns it green , the air blackens it . 
It is not near any path , and people are not fond of walking in that direction , because the grass is high and their feet are immediately wet . 
When there is a little sunshine , the lizards come thither . 
All around there is a quivering of weeds .
