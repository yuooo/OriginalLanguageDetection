Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers . 
The patrician and the knife-grinder , the duke and the peer , the limb of the law , the courtiers and townspeople , as they used to say in olden times , all are subjects of this fairy . 
They laugh and hunt , and there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis -- what a transfiguration effected by love ! 
Notaries ' clerks are gods . 
And the little cries , the pursuits through the grass , the waists embraced on the fly , those jargons which are melodies , those adorations which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable , those cherries torn from one mouth by another , -- all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial glories .
