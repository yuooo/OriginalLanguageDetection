Penetrate , at certain hours , past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection , and look behind , gaze into that soul , gaze into that obscurity . 
There , beneath that external silence , battles of giants , like those recorded in Homer , are in progress ; skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms , as in Milton ; visionary circles , as in Dante . 
What a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him , and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions of his life ! 
Alighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door , before which he hesitated . 
Here is one before us , upon whose threshold we hesitate .
