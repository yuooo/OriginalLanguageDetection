Marius , up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy , and to asides , both by habit and by taste , was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him . 
All these various initiatives solicited his attention at once , and pulled him about . 
The tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl . 
Sometimes , in his trouble , they fled so far from him , that he had difficulty in recovering them . 
He heard them talk of philosophy , of literature , of art , of history , of religion , in unexpected fashion .
