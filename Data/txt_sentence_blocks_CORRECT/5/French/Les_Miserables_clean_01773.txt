It was a little boy who had been born to the Thenardiers during one of the preceding winters , -- `` she did not know why , '' she said , `` the result of the cold , '' -- and who was a little more than three years old . 
The mother had nursed him , but she did not love him . 
When the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying , `` Your son is squalling , '' Thenardier would say ; `` do go and see what he wants . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
the mother would reply , `` he bothers me . ''
