It is a floating forest . 
And moreover , let this be borne in mind , it is only a question here of the military vessel of forty years ago , of the simple sailing-vessel ; steam , then in its infancy , has since added new miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel . 
At the present time , for example , the mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine , propelled by three thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five hundred horse-power . 
Not to mention these new marvels , the ancient vessel of Christopher Columbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man . 
It is as inexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales ; it stores up the wind in its sails , it is precise in the immense vagueness of the billows , it floats , and it reigns .
