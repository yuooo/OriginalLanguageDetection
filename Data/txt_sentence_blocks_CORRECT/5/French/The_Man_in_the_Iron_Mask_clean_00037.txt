I am here to tell you many things , 't is true ; but you must allow me to see that , on your side , you have a desire to know them . 
Before revealing the important matters I still withhold , be assured I am in need of some encouragement , if not candor ; a little sympathy , if not confidence . 
But you keep yourself intrenched in a pretended which paralyzes me . 
Oh , not for the reason you think ; for , ignorant as you may be , or indifferent as you feign to be , you are none the less what you are , monseigneur , and there is nothing - nothing , mark me ! 
which can cause you not to be so . ''
