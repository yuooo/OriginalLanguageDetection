There is no longer either pail , chain , or pulley ; but there is still the stone basin which served the overflow . 
The rain-water collects there , and from time to time a bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink , and then flies away . 
One house in this ruin , the farmhouse , is still inhabited . 
The door of this house opens on the courtyard . 
Upon this door , beside a pretty Gothic lock-plate , there is an iron handle with trefoils placed slanting .
