They resembled coopers ' drays ; they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities . 
Each dray , or rather let us say , each ladder , was attached to four horses harnessed tandem . 
On these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn . 
In the faint light , these men were to be divined rather than seen . 
Twenty-four on each vehicle , twelve on a side , back to back , facing the passers-by , their legs dangling in the air , -- this was the manner in which these men were travelling , and behind their backs they had something which clanked , and which was a chain , and on their necks something which shone , and which was an iron collar .
