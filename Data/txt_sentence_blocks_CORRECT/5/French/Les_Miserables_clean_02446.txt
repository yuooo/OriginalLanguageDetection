Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking ; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder than his self-devotion , his good will , and a little of that old rustic cunning , on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise , undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister , and the steep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoit . 
Father Fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life , and who , towards the end of his days , halt , infirm , with no interest left to him in the world , found it sweet to be grateful , and perceiving a generous action to be performed , flung himself upon it like a man , who at the moment when he is dying , should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted , and should swallow it with avidity . 
We may add , that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him , and had ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him . 
So he took his resolve : to devote himself to M. Madeleine . 
We have just called him a poor peasant of Picardy .
