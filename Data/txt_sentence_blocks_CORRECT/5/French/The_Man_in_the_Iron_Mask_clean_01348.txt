D'Artagnan passed from these considerations to the remembrance of the proscribed Porthos and Aramis . 
He saw them both , fugitives , tracked , ruined - laborious architects of fortunes they had lost ; and as the king called for his man of execution in hours of vengeance and malice , D'Artagnan trembled at the very idea of receiving some commission that would make his very soul bleed . 
Sometimes , ascending hills , when the winded horse breathed hard from his red nostrils , and heaved his flanks , the captain , left to more freedom of thought , reflected on the prodigious genius of Aramis , a genius of acumen and intrigue , a match to which the Fronde and the civil war had produced but twice . 
Soldier , priest , diplomatist ; gallant , avaricious , cunning ; Aramis had never taken the good things of this life except as stepping - stones to rise to giddier ends . 
Generous in spirit , if not lofty in heart , he never did ill but for the sake of shining even yet more brilliantly .
