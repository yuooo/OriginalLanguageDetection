Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that Marius was in existence . 
Only once , one morning , he chanced to say to Cosette : `` Why , you have whitewash on your back ! '' 
On the previous evening , Marius , in a transport , had pushed Cosette against the wall . 
Old Toussaint , who retired early , thought of nothing but her sleep , and was as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean . 
Marius never set foot in the house .
