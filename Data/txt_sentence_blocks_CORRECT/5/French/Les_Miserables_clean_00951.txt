To see a woman of the town spit in the mayor 's face was a thing so monstrous that , in his most daring flights of fancy , he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible . 
On the other hand , at the very bottom of his thought , he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was , and as to what this mayor might be ; and then he , with horror , caught a glimpse of I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack . 
But when he beheld that mayor , that magistrate , calmly wipe his face and say , `` Set this woman at liberty , '' he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement ; thought and word failed him equally ; the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case . 
He remained mute . 
The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine .
