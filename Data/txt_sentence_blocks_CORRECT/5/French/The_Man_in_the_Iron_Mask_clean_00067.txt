My governor opened the door a few moments after , and thinking I was asleep gently closed it again . 
As soon as ever it was shut , I rose , and , listening , heard the sound of retiring footsteps . 
Then I returned to the shutters , and saw my tutor and Dame Perronnette go out together . 
I was alone in the house . 
They had hardly closed the gate before I sprang from the window and ran to the well .
