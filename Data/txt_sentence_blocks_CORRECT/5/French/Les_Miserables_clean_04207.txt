How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand ? 
Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little , the reverberations of causes in the precipices of being , and the avalanches of creation ? 
The tiniest worm is of importance ; the great is little , the little is great ; everything is balanced in necessity ; alarming vision for the mind . 
There are marvellous relations between beings and things ; in that inexhaustible whole , from the sun to the grub , nothing despises the other ; all have need of each other . 
The light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths , without knowing what it is doing ; the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers .
