`` True . '' 
`` You are not in M. Fouquet 's house , but in your own . '' 
`` True ; but in spite of that , Aramis , grant me , for pity 's sake , one single word of a true friend . '' 
`` A true friend 's word is ever truth itself . 
If I think of touching , even with my finger , the son of Anne of Austria , the true king of this realm of France - if I have not the firm intention of prostrating myself before his throne - if in every idea I may entertain to-morrow , here at Vaux , will not be the most glorious day my king ever enjoyed - may Heaven 's lightning blast me where I stand !
