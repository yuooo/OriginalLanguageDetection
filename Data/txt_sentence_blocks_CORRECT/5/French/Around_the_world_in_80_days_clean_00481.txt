` Cisco was reached at seven in the morning ; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car , and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming . 
The railway track wound in and out among the passes , now approaching the mountain-sides , now suspended over precipices , avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves , plunging into narrow defiles , which seemed to have no outlet . 
The locomotive , its great funnel emitting a weird light , with its sharp bell , and its cow-catcher extended like a spur , mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades , and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines . 
There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route . 
The railway turned around the sides of the mountains , and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another .
