He never shot at a little bird . 
Although he was no longer young , it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong . 
He offered his assistance to any one who was in need of it , lifted a horse , released a wheel clogged in the mud , or stopped a runaway bull by the horns . 
He always had his pockets full of money when he went out ; but they were empty on his return . 
When he passed through a village , the ragged brats ran joyously after him , and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats .
