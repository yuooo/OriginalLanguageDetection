Finding himself too wretched to remain alone , he knocked at Aouda 's door , went into her room , seated himself , without speaking , in a corner , and looked ruefully at the young woman . 
Aouda was still pensive . 
About half-past seven in the evening Mr. Fogg sent to know if Aouda would receive him , and in a few moments he found himself alone with her . 
Phileas Fogg took a chair , and sat down near the fireplace , opposite Aouda . 
No emotion was visible on his face .
