Just as the clerk was calling the next case , he rose , and said , `` I offer bail . '' 
`` You have that right , '' returned the judge . 
Fix 's blood ran cold , but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds . 
`` I will pay it at once , '' said Mr. Fogg , taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag , which Passepartout had by him , and placing them on the clerk 's desk . 
`` This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison , '' said the judge .
