This figure probably comprises all the other corpses which were flung into this ravine the day after the combat . 
Let us note in passing that it was Dubois 's sorely tried brigade which , an hour previously , making a charge to one side , had captured the flag of the Lunenburg battalion . 
Napoleon , before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud 's cuirassiers , had scrutinized the ground , but had not been able to see that hollow road , which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of the plateau . 
Warned , nevertheless , and put on the alert by the little white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles highway , he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle , to the guide Lacoste . 
The guide had answered No .
