D'Artagnan held back Aramis by the arm , as he was about , like the rest , to alight from his carriage , and in a hoarse , broken voice , `` Do you know , Aramis , '' said he , `` whither chance has conducted us ? ''

`` Here repose men that we knew well , '' said D'Artagnan , greatly agitated . 
Aramis , without divining anything , and with a trembling step , penetrated into the chapel by a little door which D'Artagnan opened for him .
