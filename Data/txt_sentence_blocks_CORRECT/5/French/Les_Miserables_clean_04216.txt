It was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty ; a garden that was closed , but a nature that was acrid , rich , voluptuous , and fragrant ; the same dreams as in the convent , but with glimpses of young men ; a grating , but one that opened on the street . 
Still , when she arrived there , we repeat , she was only a child . 
Jean Valjean gave this neglected garden over to her . 
`` Do what you like with it , '' he said to her . 
This amused Cosette ; she turned over all the clumps and all the stones , she hunted for `` beasts '' ; she played in it , while awaiting the time when she would dream in it ; she loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass , while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head .
