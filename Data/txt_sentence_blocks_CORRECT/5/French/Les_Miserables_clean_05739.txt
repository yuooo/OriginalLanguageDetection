One of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the Rue de la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot , the other balls . 
The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high , and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crest of the barricade , and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents , mingled with bursts of grape-shot . 
The object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from the summit of the redoubt , and to compel them to gather close in the interior , that is to say , this announced the assault . 
The combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls , and from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot , the attacking columns could venture into the street without being picked off , perhaps , even , without being seen , could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt , as on the preceding evening , and , who knows ? 
take it by surprise .
