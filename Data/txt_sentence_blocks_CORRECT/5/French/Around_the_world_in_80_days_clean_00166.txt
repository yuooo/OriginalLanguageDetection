The Parsee , who was an accomplished elephant driver , covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth , and attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs . 
Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag , a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals . 
Then he offered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad , which the brigadier gratefully accepted , as one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic beast . 
Provisions were purchased at Kholby , and , while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side , Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them . 
The Parsee perched himself on the elephant 's neck , and at nine o'clock they set out from the village , the animal marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut .
