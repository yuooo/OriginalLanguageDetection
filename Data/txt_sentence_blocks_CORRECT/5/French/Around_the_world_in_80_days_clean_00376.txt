A single triangular sail , of strong canvas , was hoisted as a storm-jib , so as to hold the wind from behind . 
Then they waited . 
John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below ; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space , with little air , and the boat bouncing in the gale , was far from pleasant . 
Neither Mr. Fogg , Fix , nor Aouda consented to leave the deck . 
The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock .
