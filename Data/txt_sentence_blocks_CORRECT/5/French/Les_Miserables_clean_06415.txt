France does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the English nobility , and raining down on the post-chaise of the bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down at heel and of worn-out shoes , in memory of Churchill , afterwards Marlborough , or Malbrouck , who was assailed on his wedding-day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck . 
Old shoes and slippers do not , as yet , form a part of our nuptial celebrations ; but patience , as good taste continues to spread , we shall come to that . 
In 1833 , a hundred years ago , marriage was not conducted at a full trot . 
Strange to say , at that epoch , people still imagined that a wedding was a private and social festival , that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity , that gayety , even in excess , provided it be honest , and decent , does happiness no harm , and that , in short , it is a good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring , should begin at home , and that the household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness . 
And people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes .
