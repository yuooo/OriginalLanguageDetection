The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda began gradually to yield , and she became more herself , so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression . 
When the poet-king , Ucaf Uddaul , celebrates the charms of the queen of Ahmehnagara , he speaks thus : `` Her shining tresses , divided in two parts , encircle the harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks , brilliant in their glow and freshness . 
Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama , the god of love , and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim , as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya , in the black pupils of her great clear eyes . 
Her teeth , fine , equal , and white , glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower 's half-enveloped breast . 
Her delicately formed ears , her vermilion hands , her little feet , curved and tender as the lotus-bud , glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon , the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda .
