One felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre . 
One looked at it and spoke low . 
From time to time , if some soldier , an officer or representative of the people , chanced to traverse the deserted highway , a faint , sharp whistle was heard , and the passer-by fell dead or wounded , or , if he escaped the bullet , sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce itself in some closed shutter , in the interstice between two blocks of stone , or in the plaster of a wall . 
For the men in the barricade had made themselves two small cannons out of two cast-iron lengths of gas-pipe , plugged up at one end with tow and fire-clay . 
There was no waste of useless powder .
