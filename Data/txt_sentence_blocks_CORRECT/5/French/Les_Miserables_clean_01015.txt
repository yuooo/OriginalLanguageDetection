He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago , when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon . 
On leaving the galleys , this Jean Valjean , as it appears , robbed a bishop ; then he committed another theft , accompanied with violence , on a public highway on the person of a little Savoyard . 
He disappeared eight years ago , no one knows how , and he has been sought , I fancied . 
In short , I did this thing ! 
Wrath impelled me ; I denounced you at the Prefecture ! ''
