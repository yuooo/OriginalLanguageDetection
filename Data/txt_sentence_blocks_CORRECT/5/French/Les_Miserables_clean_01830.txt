The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness . 
One beholds floating , either in space or in one 's own brain , one knows not what vague and intangible thing , like the dreams of sleeping flowers . 
There are fierce attitudes on the horizon . 
One inhales the effluvia of the great black void . 
One is afraid to glance behind him , yet desirous of doing so .
