Monsieur d'Herblay , in Heaven 's name , tell me if you have had the idea - '' `` There is no question of that , monseigneur ; you are going beyond the object in view . 
Who spoke of Louis XIV . 
's death ? 
who spoke of adopting the example which Heaven sets in following out the strict execution of its decrees ? 
No , I wish you to understand that Heaven effects its purposes without confusion or disturbance , without exciting comment or remark , without difficulty or exertion ; and that men , inspired by Heaven , succeed like Heaven itself , in all their undertakings , in all they attempt , in all they do .
