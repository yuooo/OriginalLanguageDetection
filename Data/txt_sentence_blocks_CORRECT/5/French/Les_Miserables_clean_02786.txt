Its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace . 
Its explosions , its days , its masterpieces , its prodigies , its epics , go forth to the bounds of the universe , and so also do its cock-and-bull stories .

Its jests are sparks . 
It imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people ; the highest monuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their eternity to its mischievous pranks .
