`` Why not this evening , seeing that the lettre de cachet bears , both on the direction and inside , ` urgent ' ? '' 
`` Because this evening we are at supper , and our affairs are urgent , too ! ''

This unfortunate man has suffered long enough , since you have just told me that he has been your prisoner these ten years . 
Abridge his suffering .
