Two or three had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray , and suspended under them like a stirrup , which supported their feet . 
One of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing ; it was bread which he was eating . 
There were no eyes there which were not either dry , dulled , or flaming with an evil light . 
The escort troop cursed , the men in chains did not utter a syllable ; from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or skulls ; some of these men were yawning ; their rags were terrible ; their feet hung down , their shoulders oscillated , their heads clashed together , their fetters clanked , their eyes glared ferociously , their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses ; in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter . 
This file of vehicles , whatever its nature was , was mournful .
