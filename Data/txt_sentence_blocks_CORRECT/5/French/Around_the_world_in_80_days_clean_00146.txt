The locomotive , guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal , threw out its smoke upon cotton , coffee , nutmeg , clove , and pepper plantations , while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees , in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows , viharis -LRB- sort of abandoned monasteries -RRB- , and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture .
