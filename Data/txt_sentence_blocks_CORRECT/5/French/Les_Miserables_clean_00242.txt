And it was a crime to applaud , in 1814 , in the presence of those marshals who betrayed ; in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another , insulting after having deified ; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol , -- it was a duty to turn aside the head . 
In 1815 , when the supreme disasters filled the air , when France was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach , when Waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before Napoleon , the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it , and , after making all allowance for the despot , a heart like that of the Bishop of D -- , ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss . 
With this exception , he was in all things just , true , equitable , intelligent , humble and dignified , beneficent and kindly , which is only another sort of benevolence . 
He was a priest , a sage , and a man . 
It must be admitted , that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him , and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity , he was tolerant and easy , more so , perhaps , than we who are speaking here .
