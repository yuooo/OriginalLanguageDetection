The celebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756 , when the English first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city of Madras , down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection . 
It gradually annexed province after province , purchasing them of the native chiefs , whom it seldom paid , and appointed the governor-general and his subordinates , civil and military . 
But the East India Company has now passed away , leaving the British possessions in India directly under the control of the Crown . 
The aspect of the country , as well as the manners and distinctions of race , is daily changing . 
Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or unwieldly coaches ; now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days .
