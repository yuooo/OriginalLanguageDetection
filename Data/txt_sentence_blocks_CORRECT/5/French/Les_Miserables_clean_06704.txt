Basque , who was perfectly respectful , opened the door of the waiting-room and said : `` I will go and inform Madame . '' 
The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp , vaulted room on the ground floor , which served as a cellar on occasion , which opened on the street , was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window .

The dust rested tranquilly there .
