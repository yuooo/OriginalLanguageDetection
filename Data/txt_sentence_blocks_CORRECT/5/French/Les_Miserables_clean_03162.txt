Jupiter does not impress me as dead . 
The gods are dreams , you say . 
Well , even in nature , such as it is to-day , after the flight of these dreams , we still find all the grand old pagan myths . 
Such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel , like the Vignemale , for example , is still to me the headdress of Cybele ; it has not been proved to me that Pan does not come at night to breathe into the hollow trunks of the willows , stopping up the holes in turn with his fingers , and I have always believed that Io had something to do with the cascade of Pissevache . '' 
In the last corner , they were talking politics .
