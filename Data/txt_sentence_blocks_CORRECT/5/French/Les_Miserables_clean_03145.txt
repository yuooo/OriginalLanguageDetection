Paris carries the day , in short . 
In Paris , even the rag-pickers are sybarites ; Diogenes would have loved to be a rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the Piraeus . 
Learn this in addition ; the wineshops of the ragpickers are called bibines ; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and The Slaughter-House . 
Hence , tea-gardens , goguettes , caboulots , bouibuis , mastroquets , bastringues , manezingues , bibines of the rag-pickers , caravanseries of the caliphs , I certify to you , I am a voluptuary , I eat at Richard 's at forty sous a head , I must have Persian carpets to roll naked Cleopatra in ! 
Where is Cleopatra ?
