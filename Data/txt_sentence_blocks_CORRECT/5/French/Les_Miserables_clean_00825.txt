The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose , with two deep nostrils , towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks . 
One felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time . 
When Javert laughed , -- and his laugh was rare and terrible , -- his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth , but his gums , and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold , as on the muzzle of a wild beast . 
Javert , serious , was a watchdog ; when he laughed , he was a tiger . 
As for the rest , he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw ; his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows ; between his eyes there was a permanent , central frown , like an imprint of wrath ; his gaze was obscure ; his mouth pursed up and terrible ; his air that of ferocious command .
