What hideous , furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory ? 
What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory ? 
Some philosophers -- Voltaire among the number -- affirm that it is precisely those persons have made the glory . 
It is the same men , they say ; there is no relief corps ; those who are erect pillage those who are prone on the earth . 
The hero of the day is the vampire of the night .
