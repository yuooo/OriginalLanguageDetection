: King Louis XIV . 
The king was seated in his cabinet , with his back turned towards the door of entrance . 
In front of him was a mirror , in which , while turning over his papers , he could see at a glance those who came in . 
He did not take any notice of the entrance of D'Artagnan , but spread above his letters and plans the large silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets from the importunate . 
D'Artagnan understood this by-play , and kept in the background ; so that at the end of a minute the king , who heard nothing , and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye , was obliged to cry , `` Is not M. d'Artagnan there ? ''
