Jean Valjean had been , unconsciously , perhaps , tolerably near that side and that bridge , when Providence cast his lot in the convent of the Petit-Picpus ; so long as he had compared himself only to the Bishop , he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble ; but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general , and pride was beginning to spring up . 
Who knows ? 
He might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred . 
The convent stopped him on that downward path . 
This was the second place of captivity which he had seen .
