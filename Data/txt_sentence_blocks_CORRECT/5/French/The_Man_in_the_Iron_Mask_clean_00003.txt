In this wise they reached the basement of the Bertaudiere , the two first stories of which were mounted silently and somewhat slowly ; for Baisemeaux , though far from disobeying , was far from exhibiting any eagerness to obey . 
On arriving at the door , Baisemeaux showed a disposition to enter the prisoner 's chamber ; but Aramis , stopping him on the threshold , said , `` The rules do not allow the governor to hear the prisoner 's confession . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed , and made way for Aramis , who took the lantern and entered ; and then signed to them to close the door behind him . 
For an instant he remained standing , listening whether Baisemeaux and the turnkey had retired ; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their descending footsteps that they had left the tower , he put the lantern on the table and gazed around . 
On a bed of green serge , similar in all respect to the other beds in the Bastile , save that it was newer , and under curtains half-drawn , reposed a young man , to whom we have already once before introduced Aramis .
