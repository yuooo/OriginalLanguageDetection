They were in the open air ! 
The miasmas , darkness , horror lay behind him . 
The pure , healthful , living , joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him . 
Everywhere around him reigned silence , but that charming silence when the sun has set in an unclouded azure sky . 
Twilight had descended ; night was drawing on , the great deliverer , the friend of all those who need a mantle of darkness that they may escape from an anguish .
