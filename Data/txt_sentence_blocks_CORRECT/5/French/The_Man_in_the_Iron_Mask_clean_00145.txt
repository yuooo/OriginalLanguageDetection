`` Consider my joy when , after a year and a half 's judicious feeding - for I used to feed him up myself - the fellow - '' `` Oh ! 
I lent a good hand myself , monsieur , '' said Mouston , humbly . 
`` That 's true . 
Consider my joy when , one morning , I perceived Mouston was obliged to squeeze in , as I once did myself , to get through the little secret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of the late Madame du Vallon , in the chateau of Pierrefonds . 
And , by the way , about that door , my friend , I should like to ask you , who know everything , why these wretches of architects , who ought to have the compasses run into them , just to remind them , came to make doorways through which nobody but thin people can pass ? ''
