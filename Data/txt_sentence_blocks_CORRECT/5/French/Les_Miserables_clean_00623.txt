Style is the form of the ideal ; rhythm is its movement . 
We have said that Fantine was joy ; she was also modesty . 
To an observer who studied her attentively , that which breathed from her athwart all the intoxication of her age , the season , and her love affair , was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty . 
She remained a little astonished . 
This chaste astonishment is the shade of difference which separates Psyche from Venus .
