monseigneur , king of a people very humble , much disinherited ; humble because they have no force save when creeping ; disinherited , because never , almost never in this world , do my people reap the harvest they sow , nor eat the fruit they cultivate . 
They labor for an abstract idea ; they heap together all the atoms of their power , to from a single man ; and round this man , with the sweat of their labor , they create a misty halo , which his genius shall , in turn , render a glory gilded with the rays of all the crowns in Christendom . 
Such is the man you have beside you , monseigneur . 
It is to tell you that he has drawn you from the abyss for a great purpose , to raise you above the powers of the earth - above himself . ''
