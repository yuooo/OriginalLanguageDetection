Six men made a litter of their guns ; on this they laid the body , and bore it , with bared heads , with solemn slowness , to the large table in the tap-room . 
These men , wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they were engaged , thought no more of the perilous situation in which they stood . 
When the corpse passed near Javert , who was still impassive , Enjolras said to the spy : -- `` It will be your turn presently ! '' 
During all this time , Little Gavroche , who alone had not quitted his post , but had remained on guard , thought he espied some men stealthily approaching the barricade . 
All at once he shouted : -- `` Look out ! ''
