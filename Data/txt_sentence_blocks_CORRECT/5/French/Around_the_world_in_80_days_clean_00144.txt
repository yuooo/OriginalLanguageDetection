Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time , and now Sir Francis , reviving the conversation , observed , `` Some years ago , Mr. Fogg , you would have met with a delay at this point which would probably have lost you your wager . '' 
`` How so , Sir Francis ? '' 
`` Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains , which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to Kandallah , on the other side . '' 
`` Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles . ''
