They have always existed . 
Horace speaks of them : Ambubaiarum collegia , pharmacopolae , mendici , mimae ; and so long as society remains what it is , they will remain what they are . 
Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern , they are continually born again from the social ooze . 
They return , spectres , but always identical ; only , they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins . 
The individuals extirpated , the tribe subsists .
