He witnesses , amid his death-pangs , the immense madness of the sea . 
He is tortured by this madness ; he hears noises strange to man , which seem to come from beyond the limits of the earth , and from one knows not what frightful region beyond . 
There are birds in the clouds , just as there are angels above human distresses ; but what can they do for him ? 
They sing and fly and float , and he , he rattles in the death agony . 
He feels himself buried in those two infinities , the ocean and the sky , at one and the same time : the one is a tomb ; the other is a shroud .
