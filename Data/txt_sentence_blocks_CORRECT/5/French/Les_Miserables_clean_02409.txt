To pray to God , -- what is the meaning of these words ? 
Is there an infinite beyond us ? 
Is that infinite there , inherent , permanent ; necessarily substantial , since it is infinite ; and because , if it lacked matter it would be bounded ; necessarily intelligent , since it is infinite , and because , if it lacked intelligence , it would end there ? 
Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence , while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence ? 
In other terms , is it not the absolute , of which we are only the relative ?
