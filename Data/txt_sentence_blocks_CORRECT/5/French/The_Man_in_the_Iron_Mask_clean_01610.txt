Fouquet hastened to the brink of the river , dipped some water in his hat , with which he bathed the temples of the musketeer , and introduced a few drop between his lips . 
D'Artagnan raised himself with difficulty , and looked about him with a wandering eye . 
He beheld Fouquet on his knees , with his wet hat in his hand , smiling upon him with ineffable sweetness . 
`` You are not off , then ? '' 
cried he .
