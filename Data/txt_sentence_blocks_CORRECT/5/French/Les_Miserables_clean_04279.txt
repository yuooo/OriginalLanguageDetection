Jean Valjean had no experience of these miseries , the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted ; the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of Cosette 's silence .

He asked Cosette : -- `` Would you like to come to the Luxembourg ? ''
