Monseigneur was right , for he loved and wished to spare the young nobleman . 
He was quite right , and the event took upon itself to justify his foresight and refusal ; for scarcely had the sergeant charged with the message solicited by M. de Bragelonne gained the seashore , when two shots from long carbines issued from the enemy 's ranks and laid him low . 
The sergeant fell , dyeing the sand with his blood ; observing which , M. de Bragelonne smiled at monseigneur , who said to him , ` You see , vicomte , I have saved your life . 
Report that , some day , to M. le Comte de la Fere , in order that , learning it from you , he may thank me . ' 
The young nobleman smiled sadly , and replied to the duke , ` It is true , monseigneur , that but for your kindness I should have been killed , where the poor sergeant has fallen , and should be at rest . '
