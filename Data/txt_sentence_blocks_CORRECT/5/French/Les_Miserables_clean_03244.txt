All political opinions were matters of indifference to him , and he approved them all , without distinction , provided they left him in peace , as the Greeks called the Furies `` the beautiful , the good , the charming , '' the Eumenides . 
M. Mabeuf 's political opinion consisted in a passionate love for plants , and , above all , for books . 
Like all the rest of the world , he possessed the termination in ist , without which no one could exist at that time , but he was neither a Royalist , a Bonapartist , a Chartist , an Orleanist , nor an Anarchist ; he was a bouquinist , a collector of old books . 
He did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter , democracy , legitimacy , monarchy , the republic , etc. , when there were in the world all sorts of mosses , grasses , and shrubs which they might be looking at , and heaps of folios , and even of 32mos , which they might turn over . 
He took good care not to become useless ; having books did not prevent his reading , being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener .
