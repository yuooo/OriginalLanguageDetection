It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at . 
Puns are sometimes serious factors in politics ; witness the Castratus ad castra , which made a general of the army of Narses ; witness : Barbari et Barberini ; witness : Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram , etc. , etc. . 
The Friends of the A B C were not numerous , it was a secret society in the state of embryo , we might almost say a coterie , if coteries ended in heroes . 
They assembled in Paris in two localities , near the fish-market , in a wine-shop called Corinthe , of which more will be heard later on , and near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel called the Cafe Musain , now torn down ; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman , the second to the students . 
The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a back room of the Cafe Musain .
