: Porthos 's Epitaph . 
Aramis , silent and sad as ice , trembling like a timid child , arose shivering from the stone . 
A Christian does not walk on tombs . 
But , though capable of standing , he was not capable of walking . 
It might be said that something of dead Porthos had just died within him .
