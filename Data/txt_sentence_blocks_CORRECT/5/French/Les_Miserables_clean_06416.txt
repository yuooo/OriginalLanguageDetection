The marriage took place , therefore , in accordance with this now superannuated fashion , at M. Gillenormand 's house . 
Natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is , the banns to publish , the papers to be drawn up , the mayoralty , and the church produce some complication . 
They could not get ready before the 16th of February . 
Now , we note this detail , for the pure satisfaction of being exact , it chanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday . 
Hesitations , scruples , particularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand .
