The grenadiers of the two regiments got near enough to the ditches and intrenchments to launch their grenades , which had but small effect . 
In the meanwhile , M. d'Estrees , who commanded the fleet , having seen the attempt of the sergeant to approach the vessels , understood that he must act without orders , and opened fire . 
Then the Arabs , finding themselves seriously injured by the balls from the fleet , and beholding the destruction and the ruin of their walls , uttered the most fearful cries . 
Their horsemen descended the mountain at a gallop , bent over their saddles , and rushed full tilt upon the columns of infantry , which , crossing their pikes , stopped this mad assault . 
Repulsed by the firm attitude of the battalion , the Arabs threw themselves with fury towards the etat-major , which was not on its guard at that moment .
