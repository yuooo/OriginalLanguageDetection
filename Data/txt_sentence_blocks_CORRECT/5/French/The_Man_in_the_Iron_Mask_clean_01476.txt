Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance . 
The captain remarked their uneasiness , and , to mislead him , Gourville immediately said : `` Some friend , who has laid a wager he would catch us ; let us win the wager , and not allow him to come up with us . '' 
The patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible , but Fouquet said with much hauteur , - `` If it is any one who wishes to overtake us , let him come . '' 
`` We can try , monseigneur , '' said the man , timidly . 
`` Come , you fellows , put out your strength ; row , row ! ''
