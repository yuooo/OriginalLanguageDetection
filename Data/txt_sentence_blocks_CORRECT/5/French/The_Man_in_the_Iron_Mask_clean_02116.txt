Athos was a sort of model for the gentlemen of the country ; the Blaisois boasted of possessing this sacred relic of French glory . 
Athos was a great seigneur compared with such nobles as the king improvised by touching with his artificial scepter the parched-up trunks of the heraldic trees of the province . 
People respected Athos , we say , and they loved him . 
The physician could not bear to see his people weep , to see flock round him the poor of the canton , to whom Athos had so often given life and consolation by his kind words and his charities . 
He examined , therefore , from the depths of his hiding-place , the nature of that mysterious malady which bent and aged more mortally every day a man but lately so full of life and a desire to live .
