As soon as they had disappeared from view , the elder child hastily flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin , and clinging to it with his left hand , and leaning over the water , on the verge of falling in , he stretched out his right hand with his stick towards the cake . 
The swans , perceiving the enemy , made haste , and in so doing , they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service to the little fisher ; the water flowed back before the swans , and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towards the child 's wand . 
Just as the swans came up , the stick touched the cake . 
The child gave it a brisk rap , drew in the brioche , frightened away the swans , seized the cake , and sprang to his feet . 
The cake was wet ; but they were hungry and thirsty .
