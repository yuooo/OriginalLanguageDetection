He was learned even to erudition , and almost an Orientalist . 
Above all , he was good ; and , a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur , in the matter of poetry , he preferred the immense . 
He knew Italian , Latin , Greek , and Hebrew ; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets : Dante , Juvenal , AEschylus , and Isaiah . 
In French , he preferred Corneille to Racine , and Agrippa d'Aubigne to Corneille . 
He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and corn-flowers , and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events .
