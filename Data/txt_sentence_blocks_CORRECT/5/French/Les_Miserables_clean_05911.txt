Grantaire rose to his feet with a start , stretched out his arms , rubbed his eyes , stared , yawned , and understood . 
A fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away . 
One beholds , at a single glance and as a whole , all that it has concealed . 
All suddenly presents itself to the memory ; and the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last twenty-four hours , has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly informed . 
Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity ; the obliteration of intoxication , a sort of steam which has obscured the brain , is dissipated , and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity of realities .
