There is a divine right in Louis XVI. , there is because a Bourbon in Louis Philippe ; both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right , and , in order to clear away universal insurrection , they must be combated ; it must be done , France being always the one to begin . 
When the master falls in France , he falls everywhere . 
In short , what cause is more just , and consequently , what war is greater , than that which re-establishes social truth , restores her throne to liberty , restores the people to the people , restores sovereignty to man , replaces the purple on the head of France , restores equity and reason in their plenitude , suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself , annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord , and places the human race once more on a level with the right ? 
These wars build up peace . 
An enormous fortress of prejudices , privileges , superstitions , lies , exactions , abuses , violences , iniquities , and darkness still stands erect in this world , with its towers of hatred .
