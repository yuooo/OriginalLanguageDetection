As we have already explained , in the case of first love , the soul is taken long before the body ; later on , one takes the body long before the soul ; sometimes one does not take the soul at all ; the Faublas and the Prudhommes add : `` Because there is none '' ; but the sarcasm is , fortunately , a blasphemy . 
So Marius possessed Cosette , as spirits possess , but he enveloped her with all his soul , and seized her jealously with incredible conviction . 
He possessed her smile , her breath , her perfume , the profound radiance of her blue eyes , the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand , the charming mark which she had on her neck , all her thoughts . 
Therefore , he possessed all Cosette 's dreams . 
He incessantly gazed at , and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath , the short locks on the nape of her neck , and he declared to himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him , Marius .
