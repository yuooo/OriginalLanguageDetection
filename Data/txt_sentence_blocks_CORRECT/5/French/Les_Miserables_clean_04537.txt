Few strangers visited this edifice , no passer-by looked at it . 
It was falling into ruins ; every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it . 
`` The aediles , '' as the expression ran in elegant dialect , had forgotten it ever since 1814 . 
There it stood in its corner , melancholy , sick , crumbling , surrounded by a rotten palisade , soiled continually by drunken coachmen ; cracks meandered athwart its belly , a lath projected from its tail , tall grass flourished between its legs ; and , as the level of the place had been rising all around it for a space of thirty years , by that slow and continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns , it stood in a hollow , and it looked as though the ground were giving way beneath it . 
It was unclean , despised , repulsive , and superb , ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois , melancholy in the eyes of the thinker .
