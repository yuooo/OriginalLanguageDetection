PARVULUS Paris has a child , and the forest has a bird ; the bird is called the sparrow ; the child is called the gamin . 
Couple these two ideas which contain , the one all the furnace , the other all the dawn ; strike these two sparks together , Paris , childhood ; there leaps out from them a little being . 
Homuncio , Plautus would say . 
This little being is joyous . 
He has not food every day , and he goes to the play every evening , if he sees good .
