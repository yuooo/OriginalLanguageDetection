Each branch may become a dynasty . 
On the sole condition that it shall bend down to the people . 
Such is the theory of the skilful . 
Here , then , lies the great art : to make a little render to success the sound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble from it also , to season with fear every step that is taken , to augment the curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress , to dull that aurora , to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm , to cut all angles and nails , to wad triumph , to muffle up right , to envelop the giant-people in flannel , and to put it to bed very speedily , to impose a diet on that excess of health , to put Hercules on the treatment of a convalescent , to dilute the event with the expedient , to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a potion , to take one 's precautions against too much success , to garnish the revolution with a shade . 
1830 practised this theory , already applied to England by 1688 .
