`` Here is the receipt , '' said Aramis . 
`` And here is the money , '' returned Baisemeaux , with a threefold sigh . 
`` The order instructed me only to give a receipt ; it said nothing about receiving the money , '' rejoined Aramis . 
`` Adieu , monsieur le governeur ! '' 
And he departed , leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with joy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the confessor extraordinary to the Bastile .
