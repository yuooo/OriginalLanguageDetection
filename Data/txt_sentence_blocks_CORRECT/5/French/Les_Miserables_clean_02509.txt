But without attaining to such happiness , Mother Crucifixion 's death was very precious . 
She retained her consciousness to the very last moment . 
She spoke to us , then she spoke to the angels . 
She gave us her last commands . 
If you had a little more faith , and if you could have been in her cell , she would have cured your leg merely by touching it .
