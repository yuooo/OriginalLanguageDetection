Your grief , my friend , was so well worthy of respect . 
It was my duty to treat it gently . 
To have informed you of this misfortune , which I knew would pain you so greatly , D'Artagnan , would have been , in your eyes , to have triumphed over you . 
Yes , I knew that M. du Vallon had buried himself beneath the rocks of Locmaria ; I knew that M. d'Herblay had taken one of my vessels with its crew , and had compelled it to convey him to Bayonne . 
But I was willing you should learn these matters in a direct manner , in order that you might be convinced my friends are with me respected and sacred ; that always in me the man will sacrifice himself to subjects , whilst the king is so often found to sacrifice men to majesty and power . ''
