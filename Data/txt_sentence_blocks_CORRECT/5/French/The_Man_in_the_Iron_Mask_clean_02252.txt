The king addressed Aramis two or three times , calling him M. l'ambassadeur , which increased the surprise already felt by D'Artagnan at seeing his friend the rebel so marvelously well received at court . 
The king , on rising from table , gave his hand to the queen , and made a sign to Colbert , whose eye was on his master 's face . 
Colbert took D'Artagnan and Aramis on one side . 
The king began to chat with his sister , whilst Monsieur , very uneasy , entertained the queen with a preoccupied air , without ceasing to watch his wife and brother from the corner of his eye . 
The conversation between Aramis , D'Artagnan , and Colbert turned upon indifferent subjects .
