And amidst the noise of the third brigade , which continued to advance , the imprecations of the guards still left alive , the muffled groans of the dying , Aramis and Porthos glided unseen along the granite walls of the cavern . 
Aramis led Porthos into the last but one compartment , and showed him , in a hollow of the rocky wall , a barrel of powder weighing from seventy to eighty pounds , to which he had just attached a fuse . 
`` My friend , '' said he to Porthos , `` you will take this barrel , the match of which I am going to set fire to , and throw it amidst our enemies ; can you do so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
replied Porthos ; and he lifted the barrel with one hand .
