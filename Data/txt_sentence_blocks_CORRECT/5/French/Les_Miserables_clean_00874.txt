The second-hand dealer , to whom she was in debt for her furniture -- and what furniture ! 
-- said to her , `` If you leave , I will have you arrested as a thief . '' 
The householder , whom she owed for her rent , said to her , `` You are young and pretty ; you can pay . '' 
She divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer , returned to the latter three-quarters of his goods , kept only necessaries , and found herself without work , without a trade , with nothing but her bed , and still about fifty francs in debt . 
She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison , and earned twelve sous a day .
