Fantine had the long , white , fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pin . 
Although she would have refused nothing to Tholomyes , as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see , her face in repose was supremely virginal ; a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times , and there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there , and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state . 
This sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess . 
Her brow , her nose , her chin , presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion , and from which harmony of countenance results ; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip , she had that imperceptible and charming fold , a mysterious sign of chastity , which makes Barberousse fall in love with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia . 
Love is a fault ; so be it .
