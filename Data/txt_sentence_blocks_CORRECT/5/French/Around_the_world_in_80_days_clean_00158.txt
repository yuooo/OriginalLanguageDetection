There was nothing to say to so confident a response . 
It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point . 
The papers were like some watches , which have a way of getting too fast , and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line . 
The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption , and , leaving the train , they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis , waggons drawn by zebus , carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas , palanquins , ponies , and what not . 
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , after searching the village from end to end , came back without having found anything .
