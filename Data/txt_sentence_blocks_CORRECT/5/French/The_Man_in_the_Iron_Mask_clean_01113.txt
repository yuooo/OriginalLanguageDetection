Once in Paris , he really existed no longer . 
When he reached Guiche 's residence , he was informed that Guiche was with Monsieur . 
Raoul took the road to the Luxembourg , and when arrived , without suspecting that he was going to the place where La Valliere had lived , he heard so much music and respired so many perfumes , he heard so much joyous laughter , and saw so many dancing shadows , that if it had not been for a charitable woman , who perceived him so dejected and pale beneath a doorway , he would have remained there a few minutes , and then would have gone away , never to return . 
But , as we have said , in the first ante-chamber he had stopped , solely for the sake of not mixing himself with all those happy beings he felt were moving around him in the adjacent salons . 
And as one of Monsieur 's servants , recognizing him , had asked him if he wished to see Monsieur or Madame , Raoul had scarcely answered him , but had sunk down upon a bench near the velvet doorway , looking at a clock , which had stopped for nearly an hour .
