The poor fellows had enough to do , and did their best , to reply to the demands of the customers in the absence of their master , leaving off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence ; and when wounded pride , or disappointed expectation , brought down upon them too cutting a rebuke , he who was attacked made a dive and disappeared under the counter . 
The line of discontented lords formed a truly remarkable picture . 
Our captain of musketeers , a man of sure and rapid observation , took it all in at a glance ; and having run over the groups , his eye rested on a man in front of him . 
This man , seated upon a stool , scarcely showed his head above the counter that sheltered him . 
He was about forty years of age , with a melancholy aspect , pale face , and soft luminous eyes .
