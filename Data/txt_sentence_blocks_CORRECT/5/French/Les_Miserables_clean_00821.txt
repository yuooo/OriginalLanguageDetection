Javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness . 
It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes , we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation ; and we could easily recognize this truth , hardly perceived by the thinker , that from the oyster to the eagle , from the pig to the tiger , all animals exist in man , and that each one of them is in a man . 
Sometimes even several of them at a time . 
Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices , straying before our eyes , the visible phantoms of our souls . 
God shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect .
