There is nothing that is not strictly logical about this . 
It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent , women are conscious of their faces ; now , girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns ; the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks , more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty . 
Hence a lively taste for plain girls . 
The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good , old Fauchelevent ; he won a triple success ; in the eyes of Jean Valjean , whom he had saved and sheltered ; in those of grave-digger Gribier , who said to himself : `` He spared me that fine '' ; with the convent , which , being enabled , thanks to him , to retain the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the altar , eluded Caesar and satisfied God . 
There was a coffin containing a body in the Petit-Picpus , and a coffin without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery , public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby , but no one was aware of it .
