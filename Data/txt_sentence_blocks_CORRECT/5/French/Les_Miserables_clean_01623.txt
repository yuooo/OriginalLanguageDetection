Two of Durutte 's regiments go and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the swords of the Uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of Kempt , Best , Pack , and Rylandt ; the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat ; friends kill each other in order to escape ; squadrons and battalions break and disperse against each other , like the tremendous foam of battle . 
Lobau at one extremity , and Reille at the other , are drawn into the tide . 
In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of his Guard ; in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable squadrons . 
Quiot retreats before Vivian , Kellermann before Vandeleur , Lobau before Bulow , Morand before Pirch , Domon and Subervic before Prince William of Prussia ; Guyot , who led the Emperor 's squadrons to the charge , falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons . 
Napoleon gallops past the line of fugitives , harangues , urges , threatens , entreats them .
