These loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces . 
The street was deserted as far as the eye could reach . 
All windows and doors were closed . 
In the background rose this barrier , which made a blind thoroughfare of the street , a motionless and tranquil wall ; no one was visible , nothing was audible ; not a cry , not a sound , not a breath . 
A sepulchre .
