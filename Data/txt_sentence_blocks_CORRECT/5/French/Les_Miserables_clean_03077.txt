This sceptic 's name was Grantaire , and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus : R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything . 
Moreover , he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at Paris ; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Cafe Lemblin , and the best billiards at the Cafe Voltaire , that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage , on the Boulevard du Maine , spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget 's , excellent matelotes at the Barriere de la Cunette , and a certain thin white wine at the Barriere du Com pat .

He was a tremendous drinker to boot .
