`` There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade . 
It is a death which always implies a little rashness or want of foresight . 
Often , indeed , he who falls in one meets with but little pity . 
Those who are not pitied , Raoul , have died to little purpose . 
Still further , the conqueror laughs , and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to triumph over our faults .
