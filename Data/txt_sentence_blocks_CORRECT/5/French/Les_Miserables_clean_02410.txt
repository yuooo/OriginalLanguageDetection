At the same time that there is an infinite without us , is there not an infinite within us ? 
Are not these two infinites -LRB- what an alarming plural ! -RRB- 
superposed , the one upon the other ? 
Is not this second infinite , so to speak , subjacent to the first ? 
Is it not the latter 's mirror , reflection , echo , an abyss which is concentric with another abyss ?
