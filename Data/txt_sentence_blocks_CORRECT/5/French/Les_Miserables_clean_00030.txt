A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms . 
The diocese of D -- is a fatiguing one . 
There are very few plains and a great many mountains ; hardly any roads , as we have just seen ; thirty-two curacies , forty-one vicarships , and two hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels . 
To visit all these is quite a task . 
The Bishop managed to do it .
