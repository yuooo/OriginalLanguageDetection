Who was Cosette ? 
He did not know exactly himself . 
He did , indeed , catch an inkling of illegitimacy , the history of Fantine had always seemed to him equivocal ; but what was the use of talking about that ? 
in order to cause himself to be paid for his silence ? 
He had , or thought he had , better wares than that for sale .
