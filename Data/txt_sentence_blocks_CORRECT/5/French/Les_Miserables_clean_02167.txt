THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA Jean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and of singular aspect ; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to be looked at in winter and at night . 
This garden was oblong in shape , with an alley of large poplars at the further end , tolerably tall forest trees in the corners , and an unshaded space in the centre , where could be seen a very large , solitary tree , then several fruit-trees , gnarled and bristling like bushes , beds of vegetables , a melon patch , whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight , and an old well . 
Here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss . 
The alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs . 
The grass had half taken possession of them , and a green mould covered the rest .
