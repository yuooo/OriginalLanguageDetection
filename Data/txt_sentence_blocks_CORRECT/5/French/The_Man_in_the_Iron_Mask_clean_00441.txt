These barks , these floating-houses , are wafted to and fro by the changing winds . 
Whenever they touch a bank , it is but by chance ; and so gently , too , that the sleeping fisherman is not awakened by the shock . 
Should he wish to land , it is merely because he has seen a large flight of landrails or plovers , of wild ducks , teal , widgeon , or woodchucks , which fall an easy pray to net or gun . 
Silver shad , eels , greedy pike , red and gray mullet , swim in shoals into his nets ; he has but to choose the finest and largest , and return the others to the waters . 
Never yet has the food of the stranger , be he soldier or simple citizen , never has any one , indeed , penetrated into that district .
