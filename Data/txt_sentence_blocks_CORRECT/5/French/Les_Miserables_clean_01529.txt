That figure stood for a long time wholly in the light ; this arose from a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes , and which always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time ; but to-day history and daylight have arrived . 
That light called history is pitiless ; it possesses this peculiar and divine quality , that , pure light as it is , and precisely because it is wholly light , it often casts a shadow in places where people had hitherto beheld rays ; from the same man it constructs two different phantoms , and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it , and the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader . 
Hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations . 
Babylon violated lessens Alexander , Rome enchained lessens Caesar , Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus , tyranny follows the tyrant . 
It is a misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form .
