Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign , on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast , he fell into a wasps ' - nest of seven or eight English vessels . 
The Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea , to hide the soldiers between decks , and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel . 
Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak , and sailed proudly past under the guns of the British frigates . 
Twenty leagues further on , his audacity having increased , he attacked with his pinnace , and captured a large English transport which was carrying troops to Sicily , and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea . 
In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Gunzberg from the Archduke Ferdinand .
