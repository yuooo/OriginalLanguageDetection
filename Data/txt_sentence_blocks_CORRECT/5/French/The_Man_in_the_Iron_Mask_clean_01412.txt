`` What has happened , my God ! '' 
said some one to him . 
Fouquet opened his right hand , which was clenched , but glistening with perspiration , and displayed a paper , upon which Pelisson cast a terrified glance . 
He read the following lines , written by the king 's hand : '' ` DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET , - Give us , upon that which you have left of ours , the sum of seven hundred thousand livres , of which we stand in need to prepare for our departure . '' 
` And , as we know your health is not good , we pray God to restore you , and to have you in His holy keeping . ''
