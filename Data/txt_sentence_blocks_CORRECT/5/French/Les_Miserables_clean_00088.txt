Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented , one the Abbe of Chaliot , bishop of Saint Claude ; the other , the Abbe Tourteau , vicar-general of Agde , abbe of Grand-Champ , order of Citeaux , diocese of Chartres . 
When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment , after the hospital patients , he had found these portraits there , and had left them . 
They were priests , and probably donors -- two reasons for respecting them . 
All that he knew about these two persons was , that they had been appointed by the king , the one to his bishopric , the other to his benefice , on the same day , the 27th of April , 1785 . 
Madame Magloire having taken the pictures down to dust , the Bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper , yellowed by time , and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbe of Grand-Champ with four wafers .
