The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle , and in the loop , as in the rope of a swing , there were seated and grouped , on that particular evening , in exquisite interlacement , two little girls ; one about two years and a half old , the other , eighteen months ; the younger in the arms of the other . 
A handkerchief , cleverly knotted about them , prevented their falling out . 
A mother had caught sight of that frightful chain , and had said , `` Come ! 
there 's a plaything for my children . '' 
The two children , who were dressed prettily and with some elegance , were radiant with pleasure ; one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron ; their eyes were a triumph ; their fresh cheeks were full of laughter .
