Sometimes , in proportion as slang progresses from the first epoch to the second , words pass from the primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense . 
The devil ceases to be le rabouin , and becomes le boulanger -LRB- the baker -RRB- , who puts the bread into the oven . 
This is more witty , but less grand , something like Racine after Corneille , like Euripides after AEschylus . 
Certain slang phrases which participate in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical character resemble phantasmagories . 
Les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails a la lune -- the prowlers are going to steal horses by night , -- this passes before the mind like a group of spectres .
