They are reproached with raising , erecting , and heaping up , against the reigning social state , a mass of miseries , of griefs , of iniquities , of wrongs , of despairs , and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow in order therein to embattle themselves and to combat .

They might reply : `` That is because our barricade is made of good intentions . '' 
The best thing , assuredly , is the pacific solution .
