The reader will remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts of the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago , and of which science took advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum , so beneficially replaced at the present day by the external tincture of iodine . 
During this epidemic , the Magnon lost both her boys , who were still very young , one in the morning , the other in the evening of the same day . 
This was a blow . 
These children were precious to their mother ; they represented eighty francs a month . 
These eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand , by collector of his rents , M. Barge , a retired tip-staff , in the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile .
