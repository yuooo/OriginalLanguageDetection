You made game of me in the past ! 
You are the cause of all my misfortunes ! 
For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had , and who certainly belonged to rich people , and who had already brought in a great deal of money , and from whom I might have extracted enough to live on all my life ! 
A girl who would have made up to me for everything that I lost in that vile cook-shop , where there was nothing but one continual row , and where , like a fool , I ate up my last farthing ! 
Oh !
