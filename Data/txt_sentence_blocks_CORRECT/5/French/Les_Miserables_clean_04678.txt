Yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you , to-day you fear for your own ; to-morrow it will be anxiety about money , the day after to-morrow the diatribe of a slanderer , the day after that , the misfortune of some friend ; then the prevailing weather , then something that has been broken or lost , then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproach you ; again , the course of public affairs . 
This without reckoning in the pains of the heart . 
And so it goes on . 
One cloud is dispelled , another forms . 
There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny .
