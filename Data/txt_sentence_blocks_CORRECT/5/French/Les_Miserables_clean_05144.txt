Hucheloup , one fine morning , had seen fit to notify passers-by of this `` specialty '' ; he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint , and as he was an orthographer on his own account , as well as a cook after his own fashion , he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription : -- CARPES HO GRAS . 
One winter , the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy to obliterate the S which terminated the first word , and the G which began the third ; this is what remained : -- CARPE HO RAS . 
Time and rain assisting , a humble gastronomical announcement had become a profound piece of advice . 
In this way it came about , that though he knew no French , Father Hucheloup understood Latin , that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen , and that , desirous simply of effacing Lent , he had equalled Horace . 
And the striking thing about it was , that that also meant : `` Enter my wine-shop . ''
