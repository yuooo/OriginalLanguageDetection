Another walk made the circuit of the garden , and skirted the white wall which enclosed it . 
These alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box . 
In three of these , Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables ; in the fourth , the Bishop had planted some flowers ; here and there stood a few fruit-trees . 
Madame Magloire had once remarked , with a sort of gentle malice : `` Monseigneur , you who turn everything to account , have , nevertheless , one useless plot . 
It would be better to grow salads there than bouquets . ''
