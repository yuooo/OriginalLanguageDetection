Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly . 
They think that this will never come to an end . 
Philosophers , poets , painters , observe these ecstasies and know not what to make of it , so greatly are they dazzled by it . 
The departure for Cythera ! 
exclaims Watteau ; Lancret , the painter of plebeians , contemplates his bourgeois , who have flitted away into the azure sky ; Diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls , and d'Urfe mingles druids with them .
