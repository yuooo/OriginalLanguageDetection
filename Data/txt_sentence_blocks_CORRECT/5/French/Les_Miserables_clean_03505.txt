Caverns are better than hovels . 
What Marius now beheld was a hovel . 
Marius was poor , and his chamber was poverty-stricken , but as his poverty was noble , his garret was neat . 
The den upon which his eye now rested was abject , dirty , fetid , pestiferous , mean , sordid . 
The only furniture consisted of a straw chair , an infirm table , some old bits of crockery , and in two of the corners , two indescribable pallets ; all the light was furnishd by a dormer window of four panes , draped with spiders ' webs .
