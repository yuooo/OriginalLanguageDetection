Then he seeks for the appropriate word as one seeks for a sword . 
His mouth froths , and the froth is the word . 
In face of this mean and mighty victory , in face of this victory which counts none victorious , this desperate soldier stands erect .

Borne down by numbers , by superior force , by brute matter , he finds in his soul an expression : `` Excrement ! ''
