During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg , Passepartout had been carefully observing him . 
He appeared to be a man about forty years of age , with fine , handsome features , and a tall , well-shaped figure ; his hair and whiskers were light , his forehead compact and unwrinkled , his face rather pale , his teeth magnificent . 
His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call `` repose in action , '' a quality of those who act rather than talk . 
Calm and phlegmatic , with a clear eye , Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas . 
Seen in the various phases of his daily life , he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced , as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer .
