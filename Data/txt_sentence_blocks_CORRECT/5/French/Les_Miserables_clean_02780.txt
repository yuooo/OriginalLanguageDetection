Although Plutarch says : the tyrant never grows old , Rome , under Sylla as under Domitian , resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine . 
The Tiber was a Lethe , if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it by Varus Vibiscus is to be credited : Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus , Bibere Tiberim , id est seditionem oblivisci . 
Paris drinks a million litres of water a day , but that does not prevent it from occasionally beating the general alarm and ringing the tocsin . 
With that exception , Paris is amiable . 
It accepts everything royally ; it is not too particular about its Venus ; its Callipyge is Hottentot ; provided that it is made to laugh , it condones ; ugliness cheers it , deformity provokes it to laughter , vice diverts it ; be eccentric and you may be an eccentric ; even hypocrisy , that supreme cynicism , does not disgust it ; it is so literary that it does not hold its nose before Basile , and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than Horace was repelled by the `` hiccup '' of Priapus .
