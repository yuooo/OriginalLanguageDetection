To disembark from the Henrietta , jump into a hack , hurry to the St. Nicholas , and return with Aouda , Passepartout , and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief time , and was performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him . 
They were on board when the Henrietta made ready to weigh anchor . 
When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost , he uttered a prolonged `` Oh ! '' 
which extended throughout his vocal gamut . 
As for Fix , he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified .
