The staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it like the wall of a citadel had been reconstructed . 
The barricade had been put in order , the tap-room disencumbered , the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance , the dressing of the wounded completed , the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up , bullets run , cartridges manufactured , lint scraped , the fallen weapons re-distributed , the interior of the redoubt cleaned , the rubbish swept up , corpses removed . 
They laid the dead in a heap in the Mondetour lane , of which they were still the masters . 
The pavement was red for a long time at that spot . 
Among the dead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs .
