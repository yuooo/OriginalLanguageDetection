Of what service to thee now thy lackeys in brilliant liveries , and in the midst of them Mousqueton , proud of the power delegated by thee ! 
Oh , noble Porthos ! 
careful heaper-up of treasure , was it worth while to labor to sweeten and gild life , to come upon a desert shore , surrounded by the cries of seagulls , and lay thyself , with broken bones , beneath a torpid stone ? 
Was it worth while , in short , noble Porthos , to heap so much gold , and not have even the distich of a poor poet engraven upon thy monument ? 
Valiant Porthos !
