The church of the house , constructed in such a manner as to separate the Great Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment , was , of course , common to the Boarding-school , the Great Convent , and the Little Convent . 
The public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto entrance on the street . 
But all was so arranged , that none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world . 
Suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand , and folded in such a manner as to form , not , as in ordinary churches , a prolongation behind the altar , but a sort of hall , or obscure cellar , to the right of the officiating priest ; suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height , of which we have already spoken ; in the shadow of that curtain , pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left , the school-girls on the right , the lay-sisters and the novices at the bottom , and you will have some idea of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus assisting at divine service . 
That cavern , which was called the choir , communicated with the cloister by a lobby .
