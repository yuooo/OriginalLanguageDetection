Only since animals are mere shadows , God has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word ; what is the use ? 
On the contrary , our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them , God has bestowed on them intelligence ; that is to say , the possibility of education . 
Social education , when well done , can always draw from a soul , of whatever sort it may be , the utility which it contains . 
This , be it said , is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent , and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man . 
The visible I in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the latent I. Having made this reservation , let us pass on .
