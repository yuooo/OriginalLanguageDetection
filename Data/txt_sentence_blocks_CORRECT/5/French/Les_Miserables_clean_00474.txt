The bottomless cold paralyzes him . 
His hands contract convulsively ; they close , and grasp nothingness . 
Winds , clouds , whirlwinds , gusts , useless stars ! 
What is to be done ? 
The desperate man gives up ; he is weary , he chooses the alternative of death ; he resists not ; he lets himself go ; he abandons his grip ; and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulfment .
