A subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable . 
Each accursed race has deposited its layer , each suffering has dropped its stone there , each heart has contributed its pebble . 
A throng of evil , base , or irritated souls , who have traversed life and have vanished into eternity , linger there almost entirely visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word . 
Do you want Spanish ? 
The old Gothic slang abounded in it .
