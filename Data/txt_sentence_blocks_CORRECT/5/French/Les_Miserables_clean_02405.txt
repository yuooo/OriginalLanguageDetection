You stop me and exclaim , `` But that is the ideal convent ! '' 
It is sufficient that it may be the possible convent , that I should take notice of it . 
Thence it results that , in the preceding book , I have spoken of a convent with respectful accents . 
The Middle Ages cast aside , Asia cast aside , the historical and political question held in reserve , from the purely philosophical point of view , outside the requirements of militant policy , on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter and shall contain only consenting parties , I shall always consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive , and , in some respects , a deferential gravity . 
Wherever there is a community , there is a commune ; where there is a commune , there is right .
