The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River , and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao , on the opposite coast . 
Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade , and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place . 
Docks , hospitals , wharves , a Gothic cathedral , a government house , macadamised streets , give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes . 
Passepartout wandered , with his hands in his pockets , towards the Victoria port , gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance , and the groups of Chinese , Japanese , and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets . 
Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay , Calcutta , and Singapore , since , like them , it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy .
