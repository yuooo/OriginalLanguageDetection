In summer , we 'll go to the Glaciere with Navet , one of my pals , we 'll bathe in the Gare , we 'll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at Austerlitz , -- that makes the laundresses raging . 
They scream , they get mad , and if you only knew how ridiculous they are ! 
We 'll go and see the man-skeleton . 
And then I 'll take you to the play . 
I 'll take you to see Frederick Lemaitre .
