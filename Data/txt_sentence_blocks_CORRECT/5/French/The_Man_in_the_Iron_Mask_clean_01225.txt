And before they were able to ascertain what it was , a luminous train , accompanied by a hissing sound in the air , called their attention from the donjon to the ground . 
A second dull noise was heard from the ditch , and Raoul ran to pick up a silver plate which was rolling along the dry sand . 
The hand that had thrown this plate made a sign to the two gentlemen , and then disappeared . 
Athos and Raoul , approaching each other , commenced an attentive examination of the dusty plate , and they discovered , in characters traced upon the bottom of it with the point of a knife , this inscription : `` I am the brother of the king of France - a prisoner to-day - a madman to-morrow . 
French gentlemen and Christians , pray to God for the soul and the reason of the son of your old rulers . ''
