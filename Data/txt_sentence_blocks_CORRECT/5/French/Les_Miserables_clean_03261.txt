Very rarely , however ; twice a month at most . 
Marius ' pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer boulevards , or in the Champs-de-Mars , or in the least frequented alleys of the Luxembourg . 
He often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden , the beds of lettuce , the chickens on the dung-heap , the horse turning the water-wheel . 
The passers-by stared at him in surprise , and some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister . 
He was only a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way .
