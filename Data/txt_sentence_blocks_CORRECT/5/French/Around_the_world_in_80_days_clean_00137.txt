It happened to be the day of a Parsee festival . 
These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster -- the most thrifty , civilised , intelligent , and austere of the East Indians , among whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay -- were celebrating a sort of religious carnival , with processions and shows , in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls , clothed in rose-coloured gauze , looped up with gold and silver , danced airily , but with perfect modesty , to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines . 
It is needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth , and that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable . 
Unhappily for his master , as well as himself , his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go . 
At last , having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance , he was turning his steps towards the station , when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill , and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior .
