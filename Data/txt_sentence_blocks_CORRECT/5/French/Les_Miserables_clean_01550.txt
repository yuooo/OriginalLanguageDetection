The day was evidently turning out ill . 
Wellington shouted to his old companions of Talavera , of Vittoria , of Salamanca : `` Boys , can retreat be thought of ? 
Think of old England ! '' 
Towards four o'clock , the English line drew back . 
Suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters ; the rest had disappeared : the regiments , dislodged by the shells and the French bullets , retreated into the bottom , now intersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean ; a retrograde movement took place , the English front hid itself , Wellington drew back .
