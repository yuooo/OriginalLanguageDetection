During her entire stay there , he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point . 
He contemplated , not that girl , but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet . 
The star Sirius might have entered the room , and he would not have been any more dazzled . 
While the young girl was engaged in opening the package , unfolding the clothing and the blankets , questioning the sick mother kindly , and the little injured girl tenderly , he watched her every movement , he sought to catch her words . 
He knew her eyes , her brow , her beauty , her form , her walk , he did not know the sound of her voice .
