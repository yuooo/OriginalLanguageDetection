MY GOOD MADAM : Not a day passes without our speaking of you . 
It is our established custom ; but there is another reason besides . 
Just imagine , while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls , Madam Magloire has made some discoveries ; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over , would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours . 
Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper . 
There were things beneath .
