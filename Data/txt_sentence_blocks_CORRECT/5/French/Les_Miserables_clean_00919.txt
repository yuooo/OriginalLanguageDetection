This is not one of the least of man 's disgraces . 
At the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached , nothing is left to Fantine of that which she had formerly been . 
She has become marble in becoming mire . 
Whoever touches her feels cold . 
She passes ; she endures you ; she ignores you ; she is the severe and dishonored figure .
