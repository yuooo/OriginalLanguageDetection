How thou didst make me laugh sometimes , my sweet angel ! 
When it had been raining , thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters , and watch them pass away . 
One day I gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow , blue and green feathers . 
Thou hast forgotten it . 
Thou wert roguish so young !
