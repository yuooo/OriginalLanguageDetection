All social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife . 
The scaffold is a vision . 
The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry ; the scaffold is not a machine ; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood , iron and cords . 
It seems as though it were a being , possessed of I know not what sombre initiative ; one would say that this piece of carpenter 's work saw , that this machine heard , that this mechanism understood , that this wood , this iron , and these cords were possessed of will . 
In the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise , and as though taking part in what is going on .
