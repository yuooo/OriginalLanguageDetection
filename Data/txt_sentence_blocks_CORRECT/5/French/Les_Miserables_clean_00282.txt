He seemed very much fatigued . 
Some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi , and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade . 
He must have been very thirsty : for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink , two hundred paces further on , at the fountain in the market-place . 
On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert , he turned to the left , and directed his steps toward the town-hall . 
He entered , then came out a quarter of an hour later .
