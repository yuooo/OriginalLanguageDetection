At that period of the solstice , the light of full noonday is , so to speak , poignant . 
It takes everything . 
It applies itself to the earth , and superposes itself with a sort of suction . 
One would say that the sun was thirsty . 
A shower is but a glass of water ; a rainstorm is instantly drunk up .
