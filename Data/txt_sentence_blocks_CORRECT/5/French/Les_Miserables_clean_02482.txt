FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions , notably priests and nuns , to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions . 
At the moment when Fauchelevent entered , this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress , who was that wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur , Mother Innocente , who was ordinarily cheerful . 
The gardener made a timid bow , and remained at the door of the cell . 
The prioress , who was telling her beads , raised her eyes and said : -- `` Ah ! 
it is you , Father Fauvent . ''
