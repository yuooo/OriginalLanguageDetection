Why has Brigham Young , our chief , been imprisoned , in contempt of all justice ? 
Shall we yield to force ? 
Never ! 
Driven from Vermont , driven from Illinois , driven from Ohio , driven from Missouri , driven from Utah , we shall yet find some independent territory on which to plant our tents . 
And you , my brother , '' continued the Elder , fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor , `` will you not plant yours there , too , under the shadow of our flag ? ''
