The hours of the night fled away . 
Darkness covered the vast Place de la Bastille . 
A wintry gale , which mingled with the rain , blew in gusts , the patrol searched all the doorways , alleys , enclosures , and obscure nooks , and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant ; the monster , erect , motionless , staring open-eyed into the shadows , had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed ; and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping children . 
In order to understand what is about to follow , the reader must remember , that , at that epoch , the Bastille guard-house was situated at the other end of the square , and that what took place in the vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel . 
Towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn , a man turned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run , made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of July , and glided between the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant .
