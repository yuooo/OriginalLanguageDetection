Whether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale , in the one which contains expiation . 
Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crime , and did not result in reversing the situation , of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression , of converting the guilty man into the victim , and the debtor into the creditor , and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it . 
Whether this penalty , complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape , had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler , a crime of society against the individual , a crime which was being committed afresh every day , a crime which had lasted nineteen years .

Whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance , and consequently the most deserving of consideration .
