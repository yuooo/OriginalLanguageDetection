This was a very easy affair ; while the king was hunting , Louise was walking with some other ladies in one of the galleries of the Palais Royal , exactly where the captain of the musketeers had some guards to inspect . 
D'Artagnan did not doubt that , if he could but open the conversation on Raoul , Louise might give him grounds for writing a consolatory letter to the poor exile ; and hope , or at least consolation for Raoul , in the state of heart in which he had left him , was the sun , was life to two men , who were very dear to our captain . 
He directed his course , therefore , to the spot where he knew he should find Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
D'Artagnan found La Valliere the center of the circle . 
In her apparent solitude , the king 's favorite received , like a queen , more , perhaps , than the queen , a homage of which Madame had been so proud , when all the king 's looks were directed to her and commanded the looks of the courtiers .
