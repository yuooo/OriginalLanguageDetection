Terrible , toad-like tongue which goes and comes , leaps , crawls , slobbers , and stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night , of hunger , of vice , of falsehood , of injustice , of nudity , of suffocation , and of winter , the high noonday of the miserable . 
Let us have compassion on the chastised . 
Alas ! 
Who are we ourselves ? 
Who am I who now address you ?
