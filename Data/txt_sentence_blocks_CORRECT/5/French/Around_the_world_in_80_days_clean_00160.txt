`` Let 's go and see the elephant , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
They soon reached a small hut , near which , enclosed within some high palings , was the animal in question . 
An Indian came out of the hut , and , at their request , conducted them within the enclosure . 
The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated .
