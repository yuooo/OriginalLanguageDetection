So long as Monseigneur held his peace , she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom ; but as soon as Monseigneur began to speak , as we have seen , she obeyed passively like her mistress . 
Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even speak . 
She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him . 
She had never been pretty , even when she was young ; she had large , blue , prominent eyes , and a long arched nose ; but her whole visage , her whole person , breathed forth an ineffable goodness , as we stated in the beginning . 
She had always been predestined to gentleness ; but faith , charity , hope , those three virtues which mildly warm the soul , had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity .
