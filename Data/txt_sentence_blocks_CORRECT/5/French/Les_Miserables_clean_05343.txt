A crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience . 
Men must be stirred up , pushed on , treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance , their eyes must be wounded by the true , light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls . 
They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well-being ; this dazzling awakens them . 
Hence the necessity of tocsins and wars . 
Great combatants must rise , must enlighten nations with audacity , and shake up that sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the right divine , Caesarian glory , force , fanaticism , irresponsible power , and absolute majesty ; a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation , in their twilight splendor , of these sombre triumphs of the night .
