The Henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . 
Sometinies the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead . 
The wind , however , did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared ; it was not one of those tempests which burst , and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour . 
It continued fresh , but , unhappily , it remained obstinately in the south-east , rendering the sails useless . 
The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg 's departure from London , and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed .
