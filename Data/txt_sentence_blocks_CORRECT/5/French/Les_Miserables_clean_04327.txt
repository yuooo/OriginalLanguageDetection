In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman , and in that garden , a passable apple-tree . 
Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house , which was not securely fastened , and where one might contrive to get an apple . 
One apple is a supper ; one apple is life . 
That which was Adam 's ruin might prove Gavroche 's salvation . 
The garden abutted on a solitary , unpaved lane , bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses ; the garden was separated from it by a hedge .
