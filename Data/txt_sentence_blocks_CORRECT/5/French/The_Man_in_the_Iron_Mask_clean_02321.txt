The king is highly pleased , monsieur , with the captures you have made ; he commands you , in particular , to finish the siege you have commenced , with good fortune to you , and success for him . '' 
D'Artagnan was standing with a radiant countenance and sparkling eye .

`` I have finished , '' replied he to the messenger ; `` the city will have surrendered in a quarter of an hour . ''
