Above the door it said , `` Number 50 '' ; the inside replied , `` no , Number 52 . '' 
No one knows what dust-colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening . 
The window was large , sufficiently elevated , garnished with Venetian blinds , and with a frame in large square panes ; only these large panes were suffering from various wounds , which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage . 
And the blinds , dislocated and unpasted , threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants .
