Fix 's disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined . 
He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces . 
For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety ; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive , accompanied by a young woman , whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain . 
He hastened for a policeman ; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah . 
Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied , he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room , watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood ; for the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta , as it had done at Bombay and Suez .
