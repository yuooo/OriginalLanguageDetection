He set to work to eat up the money for these copies . 
When he saw that this wretched resource was becoming exhausted , he gave up his garden and allowed it to run to waste . 
Before this , a long time before , he had given up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time to time . 
He dined on bread and potatoes . 
He had sold the last of his furniture , then all duplicates of his bedding , his clothing and his blankets , then his herbariums and prints ; but he still retained his most precious books , many of which were of the greatest rarity , among others , Les Quadrins Historiques de la Bible , edition of 1560 ; La Concordance des Bibles , by Pierre de Besse ; Les Marguerites de la Marguerite , of Jean de La Haye , with a dedication to the Queen of Navarre ; the book de la Charge et Dignite de l'Ambassadeur , by the Sieur de Villiers Hotman ; a Florilegium Rabbinicum of 1644 ; a Tibullus of 1567 , with this magnificent inscription : Venetiis , in aedibus Manutianis ; and lastly , a Diogenes Laertius , printed at Lyons in 1644 , which contained the famous variant of the manuscript 411 , thirteenth century , of the Vatican , and those of the two manuscripts of Venice , 393 and 394 , consulted with such fruitful results by Henri Estienne , and all the passages in Doric dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth century belonging to the Naples Library .
