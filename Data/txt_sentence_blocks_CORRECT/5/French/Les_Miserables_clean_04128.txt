A gate on a garden . '' 
This is what Brujon had written the night before . 
In spite of male and female searchers , Babet managed to pass the note on from La Force to the Salpetriere , to a `` good friend '' whom he had and who was shut up there . 
This woman in turn transmitted the note to another woman of her acquaintance , a certain Magnon , who was strongly suspected by the police , though not yet arrested . 
This Magnon , whose name the reader has already seen , had relations with the Thenardier , which will be described in detail later on , and she could , by going to see Eponine , serve as a bridge between the Salpetriere and Les Madelonettes .
