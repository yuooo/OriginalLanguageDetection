This house has since been demolished and rebuilt , and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of Paris undergo . 
He occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor , between street and gardens , furnished to the very ceilings with great Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes ; the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the arm-chairs .

Long , full curtains hung from the windows , and formed great , broken folds that were very magnificent .
