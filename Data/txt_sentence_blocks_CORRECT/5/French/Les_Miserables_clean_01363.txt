All heads were raised : the sensation was indescribable ; there was a momentary hesitation in the audience , the voice had been so heart-rending ; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first . 
They asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry ; they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry . 
This indecision only lasted a few seconds . 
Even before the President and the district-attorney could utter a word , before the ushers and the gendarmes could make a gesture , the man whom all still called , at that moment , M. Madeleine , had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille , Brevet , and Chenildieu . 
`` Do you not recognize me ? ''
