`` The respect you owe the king , '' cried D'Artagnan , his eyes flashing fire , `` consists , in the first place , in making his authority respected , and his person beloved . 
Every agent of a power without control represents that power , and when people curse the hand which strikes them , it is the royal hand that God reproaches , do you hear ? 
Must a soldier , hardened by forty years of wounds and blood , give you this lesson , monsieur ? 
Must mercy be on my side , and ferocity on yours ? 
You have caused the innocent to be arrested , bound , and imprisoned ! ''
