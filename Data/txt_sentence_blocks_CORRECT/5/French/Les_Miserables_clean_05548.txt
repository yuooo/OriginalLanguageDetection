The revolution . 
It -- that barricade , chance , hazard , disorder , terror , misunderstanding , the unknown -- had facing it the Constituent Assembly , the sovereignty of the people , universal suffrage , the nation , the republic ; and it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to the Marseillaise . 
Immense but heroic defiance , for the old faubourg is a hero . 
The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance . 
The faubourg shouldered the redoubt , the redoubt took its stand under cover of the faubourg .
