And Marius heard Combeferre reply : -- `` You are wrong , Bahorel . 
The bourgeoisie loves tragedy , and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score . 
Bewigged tragedy has a reason for its existence , and I am not one of those who , by order of AEschylus , contest its right to existence . 
There are rough outlines in nature ; there are , in creation , ready-made parodies ; a beak which is not a beak , wings which are not wings , gills which are not gills , paws which are not paws , a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh , there is the duck . 
Now , since poultry exists by the side of the bird , I do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy . ''
