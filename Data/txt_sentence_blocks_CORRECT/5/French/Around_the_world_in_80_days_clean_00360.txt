IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE `` TANKADERE '' RUNS GREAT RISK OF LOSING A REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons , and at that season of the year .

It would clearly have been to the master 's advantage to carry his passengers to Yokohama , since he was paid a certain sum per day ; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage , and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai . 
But John Bunsby believed in the Tankadere , which rode on the waves like a seagull ; and perhaps he was not wrong .
