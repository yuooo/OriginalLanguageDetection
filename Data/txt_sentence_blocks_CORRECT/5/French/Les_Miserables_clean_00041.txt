One of his distant relatives , Madame la Comtesse de Lo , rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating , in his presence , what she designated as `` the expectations '' of her three sons . 
She had numerous relatives , who were very old and near to death , and of whom her sons were the natural heirs . 
The youngest of the three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income ; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke , his uncle ; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather . 
The Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts . 
On one occasion , however , he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual , while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these `` expectations . ''
