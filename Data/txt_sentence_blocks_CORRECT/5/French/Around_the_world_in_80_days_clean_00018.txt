It would be rash to predict how Passepartout 's lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg . 
It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required ; experience alone could solve the question . 
Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years , and now yearned for repose ; but so far he had failed to find it , though he had already served in ten English houses . 
But he could not take root in any of these ; with chagrin , he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular , constantly running about the country , or on the look-out for adventure . 
His last master , young Lord Longferry , Member of Parliament , after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns , was too often brought home in the morning on policemen 's shoulders .
