At the Bastille , long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , effected a junction with the procession , and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng . 
One man was heard to say to another : `` Do you see that fellow with a red beard , he 's the one who will give the word when we are to fire . '' 
It appears that this red beard was present , at another riot , the Quenisset affair , entrusted with this same function . 
The hearse passed the Bastille , traversed the small bridge , and reached the esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz . 
There it halted .
