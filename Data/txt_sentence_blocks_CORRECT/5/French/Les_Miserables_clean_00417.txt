His mother had died of a milk fever , which had not been properly attended to . 
His father , a tree-pruner , like himself , had been killed by a fall from a tree . 
All that remained to Jean Valjean was a sister older than himself , -- a widow with seven children , boys and girls . 
This sister had brought up Jean Valjean , and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother . 
The husband died .
