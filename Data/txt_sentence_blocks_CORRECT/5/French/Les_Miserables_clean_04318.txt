It was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den . 
On the day following that visit , Jean Valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning , calm as was his wont , but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed , and very angry , which resembled a burn , and which he explained in some way or other . 
This wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever . 
He would not call in a doctor . 
When Cosette urged him , `` Call the dog-doctor , '' said he .
