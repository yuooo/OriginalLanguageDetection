An inventory was being taken . 
Athos , who had no knowledge of commercial matters , felt himself a little embarrassed by material obstacles and the majesty of those who were thus employed . 
He saw several customers sent away , and asked himself whether he , who came to buy nothing , would not be more properly deemed importunate . 
He therefore asked very politely if he could see M. Planchet . 
The reply , quite carelessly given , was that M. Planchet was packing his trunks .
