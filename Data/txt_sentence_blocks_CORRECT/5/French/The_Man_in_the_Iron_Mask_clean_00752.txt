I do not live , exist even , isolated from others ; I am nothing when left to myself . 
Understand that throughout my whole life I have passed every moment of my time in making friends , whom I hoped to render my stay and support . 
In times of prosperity , all these cheerful , happy voices - rendered so through and by my means - formed in my honor a concert of praise and kindly actions . 
In the least disfavor , these humbler voices accompanied in harmonious accents the murmur of my own heart . 
Isolation I have never yet known .
