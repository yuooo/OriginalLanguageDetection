Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent ; Cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul , and sometimes , in the evening , in the wounded man 's humble abode , she warbled melancholy songs which delighted Jean Valjean . 
Spring came ; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year , that Jean Valjean said to Cosette : -- `` You never go there ; I want you to stroll in it . '' 
`` As you like , father , '' said Cosette . 
And for the sake of obeying her father , she resumed her walks in the garden , generally alone , for , as we have mentioned , Jean Valjean , who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence , hardly ever went there . 
Jean Valjean 's wound had created a diversion .
