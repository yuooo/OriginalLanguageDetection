The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts . 
Up above there were scaffoldings and ladders ; in other words , bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty . 
The New Building , which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world , was the weak point in the prison . 
The walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood , because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their beds . 
In spite of this antiquity , the authorities committed the error of confining in the New Building the most troublesome prisoners , of placing there `` the hard cases , '' as they say in prison parlance .
