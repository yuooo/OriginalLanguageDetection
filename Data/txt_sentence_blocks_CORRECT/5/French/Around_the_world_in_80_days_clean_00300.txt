He remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong . 
At one o'clock the Rangoon was at the quay , and the passengers were going ashore . 
Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg , for had not the Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers , she would have left on the 6th of November , and the passengers for Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer . 
Mr. Fogg was , it is true , twenty-four hours behind his time ; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour . 
The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong , and it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama ; and if Mr. Fogg was twenty-four hours late on reaching Yokohama , this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific .
