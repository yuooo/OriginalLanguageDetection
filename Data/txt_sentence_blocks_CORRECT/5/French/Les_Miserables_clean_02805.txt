He was a peculiar old man , and in very truth , a man of another age , the real , complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century , who wore his good , old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates . 
He was over ninety years of age , his walk was erect , he talked loudly , saw clearly , drank neat , ate , slept , and snored . 
He had all thirty-two of his teeth . 
He only wore spectacles when he read . 
He was of an amorous disposition , but declared that , for the last ten years , he had wholly and decidedly renounced women .
