Thenardier , on reaching the roof of the New Building , had found the remains of Brujon 's rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the chimney , but , as this broken fragment was much too short , he had not been able to escape by the outer wall , as Brujon and Guelemer had done . 
When one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile , one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin . 
There stood on that spot , in the last century , a house of which only the back wall now remains , a regular wall of masonry , which rises to the height of the third story between the adjoining buildings . 
This ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen there ; the middle one , that nearest the right gable , is barred with a worm-eaten beam adjusted like a prop . 
Through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall , which was a fragment of the outer wall of La Force .
