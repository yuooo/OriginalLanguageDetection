I know not who has recently discovered that Tacitus was a declaimer , that Nero was a victim , and that pity is decidedly due to `` that poor Holofernes . '' 
Facts , however , are awkward things to disconcert , and they are obstinate . 
The author of this book has seen , with his own eyes , eight leagues distant from Brussels , -- there are relics of the Middle Ages there which are attainable for everybody , -- at the Abbey of Villers , the hole of the oubliettes , in the middle of the field which was formerly the courtyard of the cloister , and on the banks of the Thil , four stone dungeons , half under ground , half under the water . 
They were in pace . 
Each of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door , a vault , and a grated opening which , on the outside , is two feet above the level of the river , and on the inside , six feet above the level of the ground .
