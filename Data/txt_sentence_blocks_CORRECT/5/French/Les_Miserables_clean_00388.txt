This is not my house ; it is the house of Jesus Christ . 
This door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name , but whether he has a grief . 
You suffer , you are hungry and thirsty ; you are welcome . 
And do not thank me ; do not say that I receive you in my house . 
No one is at home here , except the man who needs a refuge .
