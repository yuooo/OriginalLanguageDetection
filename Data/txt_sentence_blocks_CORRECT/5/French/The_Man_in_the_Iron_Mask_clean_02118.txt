Half a day passed away thus . 
The doctor formed his resolution like a brave man ; he issued suddenly from his place of retreat , and went straight up to Athos , who beheld him without evincing more surprise than if he had understood nothing of the apparition .

And he seated himself by the pillow of Athos , who had great trouble in rousing himself from his preoccupation . 
`` What is the matter , doctor ? ''
