I have traveled during the night forty leagues to come and ask pardon of the comte , whom I supposed to be still living , and to pray God , on the tomb of Raoul , that he would send me all the misfortunes I have merited , except a single one .

`` I will repeat to you , mademoiselle , '' said D'Artagnan , `` what M. de Bragelonne said of you , at Antibes , when he already meditated death : ` If pride and coquetry have misled her , I pardon her while despising her . 
If love has produced her error , I pardon her , but I swear that no one could have loved her as I have done . ' '' 
`` You know , '' interrupted Louise , `` that of my love I was about to sacrifice myself ; you know whether I suffered when you met me lost , dying , abandoned .
