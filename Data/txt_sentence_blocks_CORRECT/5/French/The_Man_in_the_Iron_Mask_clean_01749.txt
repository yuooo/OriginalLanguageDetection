`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , if I yield to your request , if I do that which you beg me , I break my word ; but if I do not do it , I disoblige you . 
I prefer the one dilemma to the other . 
Converse with your friends , and do not despise me , monsieur , for doing this for your sake , whom I esteem and honor ; do not despise me for committing for you , and you alone , an unworthy act . '' 
D'Artagnan , much agitated , threw his arm round the neck of the young man , and then went up to his friends . 
The officer , enveloped in his cloak , sat down on the damp , weed-covered steps .
