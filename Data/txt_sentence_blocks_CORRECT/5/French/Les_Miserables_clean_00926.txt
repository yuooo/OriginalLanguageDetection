This dandy was smoking , for he was decidedly fashionable . 
Each time that the woman passed in front of him , he bestowed on her , together with a puff from his cigar , some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful , such as , `` How ugly you are ! 
-- Will you get out of my sight ? 
-- You have no teeth ! '' 
etc. , etc. .
