Bodies press close to each other in misery , as in cold , but hearts draw apart . 
This woman must have loved this man , to all appearance , judging from the amount of love within her ; but probably , in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group , this had become extinct .

Nevertheless , caressing appellations had survived , as is often the case . 
She called him : My dear , my little friend , my good man , etc. , with her mouth while her heart was silent .
