: The King 's Friend . 
Fouquet was waiting with anxiety ; he had already sent away many of his servants and friends , who , anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary receptions , had called at his door to inquire after him . 
Preserving the utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended by a hair above his head , he only asked them , as he did every one , indeed , who came to the door , where Aramis was . 
When he saw D'Artagnan return , and when he perceived the bishop of Vannes behind him , he could hardly restrain his delight ; it was fully equal to his previous uneasiness . 
The mere sight of Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for the unhappiness he had undergone in his arrest .
