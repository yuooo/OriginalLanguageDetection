We are wasting our time , and we have pressing business on hand . 
Javert , you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman Buseaupied , who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve . 
You will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter Pierre Chesnelong . 
The man is a brute , who came near crushing this woman and her child . 
He must be punished .
