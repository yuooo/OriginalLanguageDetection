The whirlwind of the attack was , at that moment , so violently concentrated upon Enjolras and upon the door of the wine-shop , that no one saw Jean Valjean sustaining the fainting Marius in his arms , traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the angle of the Corinthe building . 
The reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the street ; it afforded shelter from the bullets , the grape-shot , and all eyes , and a few square feet of space . 
There is sometimes a chamber which does not burn in the midst of a conflagration , and in the midst of raging seas , beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of shoals , a tranquil nook . 
It was in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium of the barricade , that Eponine had breathed her last . 
There Jean Valjean halted , let Marius slide to the ground , placed his back against the wall , and cast his eyes about him .
