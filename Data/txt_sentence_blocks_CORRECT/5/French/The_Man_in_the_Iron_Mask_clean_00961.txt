`` And punish it with death , sire ? '' 
`` With death ; yes , monsieur , I have said it . '' 
`` Sire , '' said the surintendant , with firmness , as he raised his head proudly , `` your majesty will take the life , if you please , of your brother Philippe of France ; that concerns you alone , and you will doubtless consult the queen-mother upon the subject . 
Whatever she may command will be perfectly correct . 
I do not wish to mix myself up in it , not even for the honor of your crown , but I have a favor to ask of you , and I beg to submit it to you . ''
