In whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved , he always returned to a certain horror for Jean Valjean . 
A sacred horror , perhaps , for , as we have just pointed out , he felt a quid divinum in that man .

After the very last of men comes the convict . 
The convict is no longer , so to speak , in the semblance of the living .
