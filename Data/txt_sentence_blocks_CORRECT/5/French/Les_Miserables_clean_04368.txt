You will be a wood-louse in a cellar . 
Ah ! 
Have pity on yourself , you miserable young child , who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago , and who have , no doubt , a mother still alive ! 
I conjure you , listen to me , I entreat you . 
You desire fine black cloth , varnished shoes , to have your hair curled and sweet-smelling oils on your locks , to please low women , to be handsome .
