Gregory XVI. , at the age of eighty , held himself erect and smiling , which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop . 
Monseigneur Welcome had what the people term a `` fine head , '' but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine . 
When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms , and of which we have already spoken , people felt at their ease with him , and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person . 
His fresh and ruddy complexion , his very white teeth , all of which he had preserved , and which were displayed by his smile , gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man , `` He 's a good fellow '' ; and of an old man , `` He is a fine man . '' 
That , it will be recalled , was the effect which he produced upon Napoleon .
