`` Let us go to the king 's tailor , '' he said ; `` and since he measures the king , I think , by my faith , I may do worse than allow him to measure me ! '' 
: Who Messire Jean Percerin Was . 
The king 's tailor , Messire Jean Percerin , occupied a rather large house in the Rue St. Honore , near the Rue de l'Arbre Sec . 
He was a man of great taste in elegant stuffs , embroideries , and velvets , being hereditary tailor to the king . 
The preferment of his house reached as far back as the time of Charles IX. ; from whose reign dated , as we know , fancy in bravery difficult enough to gratify .
