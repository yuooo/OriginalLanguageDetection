The sky presented itself in all directions like an enormous calm . 
The river flowed to his feet with the sound of a kiss . 
The aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each other good night in the elms of the Champs-Elysees was audible . 
A few stars , daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith , and visible to revery alone , formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity . 
Evening was unfolding over the head of Jean Valjean all the sweetness of the infinite .
