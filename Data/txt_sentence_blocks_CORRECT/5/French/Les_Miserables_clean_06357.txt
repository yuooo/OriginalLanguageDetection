I consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold . 
Dry happiness resembles dry bread . 
One eats , but one does not dine . 
I want the superfluous , the useless , the extravagant , excess , that which serves no purpose . 
I remember to have seen , in the Cathedral of Strasburg , a clock , as tall as a three-story house which marked the hours , which had the kindness to indicate the hour , but which had not the air of being made for that ; and which , after having struck midday , or midnight , -- midday , the hour of the sun , or midnight , the hour of love , -- or any other hour that you like , gave you the moon and the stars , the earth and the sea , birds and fishes , Phoebus and Phoebe , and a host of things which emerged from a niche , and the twelve apostles , and the Emperor Charles the Fifth , and Eponine , and Sabinus , and a throng of little gilded goodmen , who played on the trumpet to boot .
