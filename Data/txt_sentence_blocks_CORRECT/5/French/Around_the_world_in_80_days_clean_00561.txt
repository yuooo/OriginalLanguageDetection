Colonel Proctor was one of the most seriously hurt ; he had fought bravely , and a ball had entered his groin . 
He was carried into the station with the other wounded passengers , to receive such attention as could be of avail . 
Aouda was safe ; and Phileas Fogg , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch . 
Fix was slightly wounded in the arm . 
But Passepartout was not to be found , and tears coursed down Aouda 's cheeks .
