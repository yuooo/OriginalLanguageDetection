He is the son of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas . 
Ah ! 
he is very nice . 
He idolizes me so , that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes , he said to me : ` Mamselle , make your gloves into fritters , and I will eat them . ' 
It is only artists who can say such things as that .
