Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him , we know not why or how , and he repaired to la Maison de Nantes , escorted by a vast crowd of people , who for several days had been agog with expectation of a convocation of the States .

A report was spread during the night , that the king was coming in great haste on post horses , and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest .
