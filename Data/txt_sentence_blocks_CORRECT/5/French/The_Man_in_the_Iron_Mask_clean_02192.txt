Grimaud descended to the comte 's bed-chamber , showed the captain with his finger the place of the empty bed , and raised his eyes eloquently towards Heaven . 
`` Yes , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` yes , good Grimaud - now with the son he loved so much ! '' 
Grimaud left the chamber , and led the way to the hall , where , according to the custom of the province , the body was laid out , previously to being put away forever . 
D'Artagnan was struck at seeing two open coffins in the hall . 
In reply to the mute invitation of Grimaud , he approached , and saw in one of them Athos , still handsome in death , and , in the other , Raoul with his eyes closed , his cheeks pearly as those of the Palls of Virgil , with a smile on his violet lips .
