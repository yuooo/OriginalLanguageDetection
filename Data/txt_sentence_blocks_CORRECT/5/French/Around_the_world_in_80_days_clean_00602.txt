At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start . 
The passengers took their places on it , and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks . 
The two great sails were hoisted , and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour . 
The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha , as the birds fly , is at most two hundred miles . 
If the wind held good , the distance might be traversed in five hours ; if no accident happened the sledge might reach Omaha by one o'clock .
