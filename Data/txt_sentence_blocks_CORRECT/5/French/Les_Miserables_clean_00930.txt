The cloud of spectators followed , jesting , in a paroxysm of delight . 
Supreme misery an occasion for obscenity . 
On arriving at the police station , which was a low room , warmed by a stove , with a glazed and grated door opening on the street , and guarded by a detachment , Javert opened the door , entered with Fantine , and shut the door behind him , to the great disappointment of the curious , who raised themselves on tiptoe , and craned their necks in front of the thick glass of the station-house , in their effort to see . 
Curiosity is a sort of gluttony . 
To see is to devour .
