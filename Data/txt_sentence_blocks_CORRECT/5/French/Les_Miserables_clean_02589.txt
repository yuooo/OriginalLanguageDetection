I shall have a hammer , a chisel , and some pincers in my pocket . 
The hearse halts , the undertaker 's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down . 
The priest says the prayers , makes the sign of the cross , sprinkles the holy water , and takes his departure . 
I am left alone with Father Mestienne . 
He is my friend , I tell you .
