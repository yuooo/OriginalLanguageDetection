Jean Valjean did violence to his habits , and took Cosette to see these rejoicings , for the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before , and of effacing , beneath the smiling tumult of all Paris , the abominable thing which had passed before her . 
The review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural ; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter . 
However , this trip seemed to attain its object . 
Cosette , who made it her law to please her father , and to whom , moreover , all spectacles were a novelty , accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth , and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete ; so that Jean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded , and that no trace of that hideous vision remained . 
Some days later , one morning , when the sun was shining brightly , and they were both on the steps leading to the garden , another infraction of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself , and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused Cosette to adopt , Cosette , in a wrapper , was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star ; and , with her head bathed in light , rosy after a good sleep , submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man , she was picking a daisy to pieces .
