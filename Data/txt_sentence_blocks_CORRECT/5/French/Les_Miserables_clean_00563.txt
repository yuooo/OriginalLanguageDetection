Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life ? 
Did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny ; that there no longer remained a middle course for him ; that if he were not henceforth the best of men , he would be the worst ; that it behooved him now , so to speak , to mount higher than the Bishop , or fall lower than the convict ; that if he wished to become good be must become an angel ; that if he wished to remain evil , he must become a monster ? 
Here , again , some questions must be put , which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere : did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought , in a confused way ? 
Misfortune certainly , as we have said , does form the education of the intelligence ; nevertheless , it is doubtful whether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated . 
If these ideas occurred to him , he but caught glimpses of , rather than saw them , and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion .
