They have , in the country of Pontarlier , whither you are going , Monsieur Valjean , a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry , my sister . 
It is their cheese-dairies , which they call fruitieres . ' 
`` Then my brother , while urging the man to eat , explained to him , with great minuteness , what these fruitieres of Pontarlier were ; that they were divided into two classes : the big barns which belong to the rich , and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer , and the associated fruitieres , which belong to the poor ; these are the peasants of mid-mountain , who hold their cows in common , and share the proceeds . 
` They engage the services of a cheese-maker , whom they call the grurin ; the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a day , and marks the quantity on a double tally . 
It is towards the end of April that the work of the cheese-dairies begins ; it is towards the middle of June that the cheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains . '
