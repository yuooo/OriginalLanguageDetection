Take away Louis Philippe the king , there remains the man . 
And the man is good . 
He is good at times even to the point of being admirable . 
Often , in the midst of his gravest souvenirs , after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent , he returned at night to his apartments , and there , exhausted with fatigue , overwhelmed with sleep , what did he do ? 
He took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit , considering it something to hold his own against Europe , but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner .
