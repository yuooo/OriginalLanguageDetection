It is superb ; it has a prodigious 14th of July , which delivers the globe ; it forces all nations to take the oath of tennis ; its night of the 4th of August dissolves in three hours a thousand years of feudalism ; it makes of its logic the muscle of unanimous will ; it multiplies itself under all sorts of forms of the sublime ; it fills with its light Washington , Kosciusko , Bolivar , Bozzaris , Riego , Bem , Manin , Lopez , John Brown , Garibaldi ; it is everywhere where the future is being lighted up , at Boston in 1779 , at the Isle de Leon in 1820 , at Pesth in 1848 , at Palermo in 1860 , it whispers the mighty countersign : Liberty , in the ear of the American abolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper 's Ferry , and in the ear of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow , to the Archi before the Gozzi inn on the seashore ; it creates Canaris ; it creates Quiroga ; it creates Pisacane ; it irradiates the great on earth ; it was while proceeding whither its breath urge them , that Byron perished at Missolonghi , and that Mazet died at Barcelona ; it is the tribune under the feet of Mirabeau , and a crater under the feet of Robespierre ; its books , its theatre , its art , its science , its literature , its philosophy , are the manuals of the human race ; it has Pascal , Regnier , Corneille , Descartes , Jean-Jacques : Voltaire for all moments , Moliere for all centuries ; it makes its language to be talked by the universal mouth , and that language becomes the word ; it constructs in all minds the idea of progress , the liberating dogmas which it forges are for the generations trusty friends , and it is with the soul of its thinkers and its poets that all heroes of all nations have been made since 1789 ; this does not prevent vagabondism , and that enormous genius which is called Paris , while transfiguring the world by its light , sketches in charcoal Bouginier 's nose on the wall of the temple of Theseus and writes Credeville the thief on the Pyramids . 
Paris is always showing its teeth ; when it is not scolding it is laughing . 
Such is Paris . 
The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe . 
A heap of mud and stone , if you will , but , above all , a moral being .
