Louise , half-dead , caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers , whose face betrayed unusual emotion . 
`` You wished to speak with me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said she , in a voice broken by anger and pain . 
`` What had you to say to me ? ''

'' 
She uttered a faint cry ; pierced to the heart by this new wound , she went her way , like one of those poor birds which , struck unto death , seek the shade of the thicket in which to die .
