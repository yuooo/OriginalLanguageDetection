`` Why did you not write simply these words : '' ` MADEMOISELLE , - Instead of cursing you , I love you and I die . ' '' 
`` That is true , '' exclaimed Raoul , with a sinister kind of joy . 
And tearing the letter he had just taken back , he wrote the following words upon a leaf of his tablets : `` To procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you , I commit the baseness of writing to you ; and to punish myself for that baseness , I die . '' 
And he signed it . 
`` You will give her these tablets , captain , will you not ? ''
