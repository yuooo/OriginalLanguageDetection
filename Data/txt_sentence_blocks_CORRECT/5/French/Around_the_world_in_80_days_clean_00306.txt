At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations : English , French , American , and Dutch , men-of-war and trading vessels , Japanese and Chinese junks , sempas , tankas , and flower-boats , which formed so many floating parterres . 
Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow . 
On going into a barber 's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old , at which age they are permitted to wear yellow , which is the Imperial colour . 
Passepartout , without exactly knowing why , thought this very funny . 
On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic , he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down .
