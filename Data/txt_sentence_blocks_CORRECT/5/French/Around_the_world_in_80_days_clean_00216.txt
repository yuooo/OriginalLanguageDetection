Passepartout made it a point , as he made his purchases , to take a good look at the city . 
It was formerly defended by a noble fort , which has since become a state prison ; its commerce has dwindled away , and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street . 
At last he came upon an elderly , crusty Jew , who sold second-hand articles , and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff , a large mantle , and a fine otter-skin pelisse , for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds . 
He then returned triumphantly to the station .
