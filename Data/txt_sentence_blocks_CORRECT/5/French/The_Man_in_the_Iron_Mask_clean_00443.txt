Accept it , as I offer it you - sincerely , cheerfully . 
Forthwith , without a moment 's pause , I will unharness two of my horses , which are attached to the carriage yonder , and they , accompanied by my servant - my deaf and dumb attendant - shall conduct you - traveling throughout the night , sleeping during the day - to the locality I have described ; and I shall , at least , have the satisfaction of knowing that I have rendered to my prince the major service he himself preferred . 
I shall have made one human being happy ; and Heaven for that will hold me in better account than if I had made one man powerful ; the former task is far more difficult . 
And now , monseigneur , your answer to this proposition ? 
Here is the money .
