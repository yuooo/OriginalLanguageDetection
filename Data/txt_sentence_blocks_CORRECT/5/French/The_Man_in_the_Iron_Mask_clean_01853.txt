`` In common prudence , '' said Aramis , `` let us go back into the grotto ; the voices evidently draw nearer , we shall soon know what we have to trust to . '' 
They re-entered , but had scarcely proceeded a hundred steps in the darkness , when a noise like the hoarse sigh of a creature in distress resounded through the cavern , and breathless , rapid , terrified , a fox passed like a flash of lightning before the fugitives , leaped over the boat and disappeared , leaving behind its sour scent , which was perceptible for several seconds under the low vaults of the cave . 
`` The fox ! '' 
cried the Bretons , with the glad surprise of born hunters . 
`` Accursed mischance ! ''
