The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers , many of whom disembarked at Singapore , among them a number of Indians , Ceylonese , Chinamen , Malays , and Portuguese , mostly second-class travellers . 
The weather , which had hitherto been fine , changed with the last quarter of the moon . 
The sea rolled heavily , and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm , but happily blew from the south-west , and thus aided the steamer 's progress . 
The captain as often as possible put up his sails , and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China . 
Owing to the defective construction of the Rangoon , however , unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather ; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause , while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses , did not seem to affect his master in the least .
