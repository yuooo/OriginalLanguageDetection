What had taken place may be related in a few words . 
Eponine had been the cause of everything . 
After the evening of the 3d of June she had cherished a double idea , to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet , and to separate Marius and Cosette . 
She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman , while Eponine disguised herself like a man . 
It was she who had conveyed to Jean Valjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning : `` Leave your house . ''
