The elder had also her chimera ; she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor , a contractor , a splendidly stupid husband , a million made man , or even a prefect ; the receptions of the Prefecture , an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck , official balls , the harangues of the town-hall , to be `` Madame la Prefete , '' -- all this had created a whirlwind in her imagination . 
Thus the two sisters strayed , each in her own dream , at the epoch when they were young girls . 
Both had wings , the one like an angel , the other like a goose . 
No ambition is ever fully realized , here below at least . 
No paradise becomes terrestrial in our day .
