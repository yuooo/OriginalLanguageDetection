As for the convent , its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great . 
Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners . 
Upon the occasion of the archbishop 's next visit , the prioress recounted the affair to his Grace , making something of a confession at the same time , and yet boasting of her deed . 
On leaving the convent , the archbishop mentioned it with approval , and in a whisper to M. de Latil , Monsieur 's confessor , afterwards Archbishop of Reims and Cardinal . 
This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread , for it made its way to Rome .
