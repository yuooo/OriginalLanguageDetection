He was absorbed , in fact . 
Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence , he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him . 
In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled , each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance , he perceived with terror , mingled with rage , a sort of frightful accumulation of things , collecting and mounting above him , beyond the range of his vision , -- laws , prejudices , men , and deeds , -- whose outlines escaped him , whose mass terrified him , and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization . 
He distinguished , here and there in that swarming and formless mass , now near him , now afar off and on inaccessible table-lands , some group , some detail , vividly illuminated ; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel ; there the gendarme and his sword ; yonder the mitred archbishop ; away at the top , like a sort of sun , the Emperor , crowned and dazzling . 
It seemed to him that these distant splendors , far from dissipating his night , rendered it more funereal and more black .
