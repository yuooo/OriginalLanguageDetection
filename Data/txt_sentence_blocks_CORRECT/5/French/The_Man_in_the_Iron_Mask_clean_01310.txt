The service commanded by M. de Beaufort was happily accomplished . 
The flotilla , sent to Toulon by the exertions of Raoul , had set out , dragging after it in little nutshells , almost invisible , the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers put in requisition for the service of the fleet . 
The time , so short , which remained for father and son to live together , appeared to go by with double rapidity , like some swift stream that flows towards eternity . 
Athos and Raoul returned to Toulon , which began to be filled with the noise of carriages , with the noise of arms , the noise of neighing horses . 
The trumpeters sounded their spirited marches ; the drummers signalized their strength ; the streets were overflowing with soldiers , servants , and tradespeople .
