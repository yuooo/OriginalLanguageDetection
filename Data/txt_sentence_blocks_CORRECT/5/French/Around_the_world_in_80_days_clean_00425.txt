This `` great attraction '' was to close the performance . 
Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators , comprising Europeans and natives , Chinese and Japanese , men , women and children , who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage . 
The musicians took up a position inside , and were vigorously performing on their gongs , tam-tams , flutes , bones , tambourines , and immense drums . 
The performance was much like all acrobatic displays ; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world . 
One , with a fan and some bits of paper , performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers ; another traced in the air , with the odorous smoke of his pipe , a series of blue words , which composed a compliment to the audience ; while a third juggled with some lighted candles , which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips , and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling .
