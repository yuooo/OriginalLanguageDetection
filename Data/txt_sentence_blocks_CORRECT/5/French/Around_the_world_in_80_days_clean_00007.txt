He lived alone in his house in Saville Row , whither none penetrated . 
A single domestic sufficed to serve him . 
He breakfasted and dined at the club , at hours mathematically fixed , in the same room , at the same table , never taking his meals with other members , much less bringing a guest with him ; and went home at exactly midnight , only to retire at once to bed . 
He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members . 
He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row , either in sleeping or making his toilet .
