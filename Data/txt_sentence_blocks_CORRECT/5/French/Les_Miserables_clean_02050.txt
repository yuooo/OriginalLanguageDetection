It was the road to Bicetre . 
It was through it that , under the Empire and the Restoration , prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of their execution . 
It was there , that , about 1829 , was committed that mysterious assassination , called `` The assassination of the Fontainebleau barrier , '' whose authors justice was never able to discover ; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated , a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled . 
Take a few steps , and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe , where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder , as in the melodramas . 
A few paces more , and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the Barriere Saint-Jacques , that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold , that miserable and shameful Place de Grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society , which recoiled before the death penalty , neither daring to abolish it with grandeur , nor to uphold it with authority .
