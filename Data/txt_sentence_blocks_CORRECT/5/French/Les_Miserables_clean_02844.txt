Prudery is a demi-virtue and a demi-vice . 
To prudery she added bigotry , a well-assorted lining . 
She belonged to the society of the Virgin , wore a white veil on certain festivals , mumbled special orisons , revered `` the holy blood , '' venerated `` the sacred heart , '' remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful , and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble , and through great rays of gilded wood . 
She had a chapel friend , an ancient virgin like herself , named Mademoiselle Vaubois , who was a positive blockhead , and beside whom Mademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle . 
Beyond the Agnus Dei and Ave Maria , Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves .
