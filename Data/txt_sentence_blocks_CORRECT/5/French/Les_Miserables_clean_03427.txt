These men patiently pursue these bourgeois . 
They experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a man from the country . 
These men are terrible , when one encounters them , or catches a glimpse of them , towards midnight , on a deserted boulevard . 
They do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists ; one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows , that they are in no wise distinct from them , that they possess no other soul than the darkness , and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life , that they have separated from the night . 
What is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish ?
