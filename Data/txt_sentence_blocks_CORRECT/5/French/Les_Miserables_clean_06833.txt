A fresh surprise for Marius . 
The man who entered was an utter stranger to him . 
This man , who was old , moreover , had a thick nose , his chin swathed in a cravat , green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes , and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in `` high life . '' 
His hair was gray . 
He was dressed in black from head to foot , in garments that were very threadbare but clean ; a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch .
