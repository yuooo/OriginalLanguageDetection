`` Monseigneur , wait the results ere you judge me , '' said Aramis . 
`` I say that , in such a case , I bless and forgive you . 
If , on the other hand , you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of fortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven ; if by your means I am enabled to live in the memory of man , and confer luster on my race by deeds of valor , or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people ; if , from my present depths of sorrow , aided by your generous hand , I raise myself to the very height of honor , then to you , whom I thank with blessings , to you will I offer half my power and my glory : though you would still be but partly recompensed , and your share must always remain incomplete , since I could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied Aramis , moved by the pallor and excitement of the young man , `` the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and admiration . 
It is not you who will have to thank me , but rather the nation whom you will render happy , the posterity whose name you will make glorious .
