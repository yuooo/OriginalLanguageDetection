The devil may pass through it , but the good God dwells here . 
This suffices me . 
My brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me . 
I understand him without his speaking , and we abandon ourselves to the care of Providence . 
That is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul .
