The sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north-east , the sails were hoisted , and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer .

His master 's last exploit , the consequences of which he ignored , enchanted him . 
Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow . 
He formed warm friendships with the sailors , and amazed them with his acrobatic feats .
