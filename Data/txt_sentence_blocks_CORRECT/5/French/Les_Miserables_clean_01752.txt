The English main-mast rises to a height of two hundred and seventeen feet above the water-line . 
The navy of our fathers employed cables , ours employs chains . 
The simple pile of chains on a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high , twenty feet in breadth , and eight feet in depth . 
And how much wood is required to make this ship ? 
Three thousand cubic metres .
