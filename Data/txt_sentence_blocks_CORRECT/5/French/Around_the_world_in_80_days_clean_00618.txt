If Phileas Fogg had left in the China , one of the fastest steamers on the Atlantic , he would have reached Liverpool , and then London , within the period agreed upon . 
Mr. Fogg left the hotel alone , after giving Passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform Aouda to be ready at an instant 's notice . 
He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart . 
Several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe .
