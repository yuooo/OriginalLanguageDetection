Fouquet raised himself up in his chair . 
`` Pardon me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` if I did not myself receive you when coming in the king 's name . ''

`` Monseigneur , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` I only come to you in the king 's name to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles . '' 
The clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet , which still remained overcast .
