It is the language of wretchedness . 
We may be stopped ; the fact may be put to us in general terms , which is one way of attenuating it ; we may be told , that all trades , professions , it may be added , all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence , have their own slang . 
The merchant who says : `` Montpellier not active , Marseilles fine quality , '' the broker on ` change who says : `` Assets at end of current month , '' the gambler who says : `` Tiers et tout , refait de pique , '' the sheriff of the Norman Isles who says : The holder in fee reverting to his landed estate can not claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estate by the mortgagor , '' the playwright who says : `` The piece was hissed , '' the comedian who says : `` I 've made a hit , '' the philosopher who says : `` Phenomenal triplicity , '' the huntsman who says : `` Voileci allais , Voileci fuyant , '' the phrenologist who says : `` Amativeness , combativeness , secretiveness , '' the infantry soldier who says : `` My shooting-iron , '' the cavalry-man who says : `` My turkey-cock , '' the fencing-master who says : `` Tierce , quarte , break , '' the printer who says : `` My shooting-stick and galley , '' -- all , printer , fencing-master , cavalry dragoon , infantry-man , phrenologist , huntsman , philosopher , comedian , playwright , sheriff , gambler , stock-broker , and merchant , speak slang . 
The painter who says : `` My grinder , '' the notary who says : `` My Skip-the-Gutter , '' the hairdresser who says : `` My mealyback , '' the cobbler who says : `` My cub , '' talks slang . 
Strictly speaking , if one absolutely insists on the point , all the different fashions of saying the right and the left , the sailor 's port and starboard , the scene-shifter 's court-side , and garden-side , the beadle 's Gospel-side and Epistle-side , are slang .
