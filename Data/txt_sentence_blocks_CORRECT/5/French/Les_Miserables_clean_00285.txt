The man bent his steps towards this inn , which was the best in the country-side . 
He entered the kitchen , which opened on a level with the street . 
All the stoves were lighted ; a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace . 
The host , who was also the chief cook , was going from one stew-pan to another , very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners , whose loud talking , conversation , and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment . 
Any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners .
