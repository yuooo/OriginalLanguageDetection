I do not understand how people can habitually take Turks in bad part ; Mohammed had his good points ; respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques ! 
Let us not insult Mohammedanism , the only religion which is ornamented with a hen-roost ! 
Now , I insist on a drink . 
The earth is a great piece of stupidity . 
And it appears that they are going to fight , all those imbeciles , and to break each other 's profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer , in the month of June , when they might go off with a creature on their arm , to breathe the immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows !
