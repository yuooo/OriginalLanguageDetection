I resume . 
This book , Les Miserables , is no less your mirror than ours . 
Certain men , certain castes , rise in revolt against this book , -- I understand that . 
Mirrors , those revealers of the truth , are hated ; that does not prevent them from being of use . 
As for myself , I have written for all , with a profound love for my own country , but without being engrossed by France more than by any other nation .
