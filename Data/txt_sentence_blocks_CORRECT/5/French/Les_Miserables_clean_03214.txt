For sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner . 
This Restaurant Rousseau , where so few bottles and so many water carafes were emptied , was a calming potion rather than a restaurant . 
It no longer exists . 
The proprietor had a fine nickname : he was called Rousseau the Aquatic . 
Thus , breakfast four sous , dinner sixteen sous ; his food cost him twenty sous a day ; which made three hundred and sixty-five francs a year .
