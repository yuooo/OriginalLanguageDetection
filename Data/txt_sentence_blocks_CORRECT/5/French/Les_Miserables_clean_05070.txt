Two minutes later , a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing through the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse , encountered the lad brandishing his pistol and singing : -- La nuit on ne voit rien , Le jour on voit tres bien , D'un ecrit apocrypha Le bourgeois s ` ebouriffe , Pratiquez la vertu , Tutu , chapeau pointu ! 
-LSB- 44 -RSB- -LSB- 44 -RSB- At night one sees nothing , by day one sees very well ; the bourgeois gets flurried over an apocryphal scrawl , practice virtue , tutu , pointed hat ! 
It was little Gavroche on his way to the wars . 
On the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger . 
Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march , and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion ?
