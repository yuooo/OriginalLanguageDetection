Towards midnight , a man was prowling about , or rather , climbing in the direction of the hollow road of Ohain . 
To all appearance he was one of those whom we have just described , -- neither English nor French , neither peasant nor soldier , less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having theft for his victory , and come to rifle Waterloo . 
He was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat ; he was uneasy and audacious ; he walked forwards and gazed behind him . 
Who was this man ? 
The night probably knew more of him than the day .
