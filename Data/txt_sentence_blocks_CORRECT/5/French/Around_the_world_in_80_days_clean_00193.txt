The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim , who , he said , was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race , and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant . 
She had received a thoroughly English education in that city , and , from her manners and intelligence , would be thought an European . 
Her name was Aouda . 
Left an orphan , she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund ; and , knowing the fate that awaited her , she escaped , was retaken , and devoted by the rajah 's relatives , who had an interest in her death , to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape . 
The Parsee 's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design .
