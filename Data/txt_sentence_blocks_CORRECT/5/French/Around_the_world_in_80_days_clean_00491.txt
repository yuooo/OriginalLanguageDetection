Elder Hitch , as is seen , was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains . 
Then , emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures , he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times : how that , in Israel , a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of the new religion , and bequeathed them to his son Mormon ; how , many centuries later , a translation of this precious book , which was written in Egyptian , was made by Joseph Smith , junior , a Vermont farmer , who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825 ; and how , in short , the celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest , and gave him the annals of the Lord . 
Several of the audience , not being much interested in the missionary 's narrative , here left the car ; but Elder Hitch , continuing his lecture , related how Smith , junior , with his father , two brothers , and a few disciples , founded the church of the `` Latter Day Saints , '' which , adopted not only in America , but in England , Norway and Sweden , and Germany , counts many artisans , as well as men engaged in the liberal professions , among its members ; how a colony was established in Ohio , a temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars , and a town built at Kirkland ; how Smith became an enterprising banker , and received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by Abraham and several famous Egyptians . 
The Elder 's story became somewhat wearisome , and his audience grew gradually less , until it was reduced to twenty passengers . 
But this did not disconcert the enthusiast , who proceeded with the story of Joseph Smith 's bankruptcy in 1837 , and how his ruined creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers ; his reappearance some years afterwards , more honourable and honoured than ever , at Independence , Missouri , the chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples , and his pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles , and retirement into the Far West .
