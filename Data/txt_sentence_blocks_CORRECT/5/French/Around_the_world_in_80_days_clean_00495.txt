The Salt Lake , seventy miles long and thirty-five wide , is situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea . 
Quite different from Lake Asphaltite , whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea , it contains considerable salt , and one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter , its specific weight being 1,170 , and , after being distilled , 1,000 . 
Fishes are , of course , unable to live in it , and those which descend through the Jordan , the Weber , and other streams soon perish . 
The country around the lake was well cultivated , for the Mormons are mostly farmers ; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals , fields of wheat , corn , and other cereals , luxuriant prairies , hedges of wild rose , clumps of acacias and milk-wort , would have been seen six months later . 
Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow .
