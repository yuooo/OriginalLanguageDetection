It would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed . 
Perhaps it was a lever ; possibly it was a club . 
In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner 's candlestick .

These miners ' candlesticks are of massive iron , terminated at the lower extremity by a point , by means of which they are stuck into the rock .
