At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling Quiot 's brigade on La Haie-Sainte , and Ney pushed forward the right wing of the French against the left wing of the English , which rested on Papelotte . 
The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint ; the plan was to draw Wellington thither , and to make him swerve to the left . 
This plan would have succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the brave Belgians of Perponcher 's division had not held the position solidly , and Wellington , instead of massing his troops there , could confine himself to despatching thither , as reinforcements , only four more companies of guards and one battalion from Brunswick . 
The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated , in fact , to overthrow the English left , to cut off the road to Brussels , to bar the passage against possible Prussians , to force Mont-Saint-Jean , to turn Wellington back on Hougomont , thence on Braine-l'Alleud , thence on Hal ; nothing easier . 
With the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded Papelotte was taken ; La Haie-Sainte was carried .
