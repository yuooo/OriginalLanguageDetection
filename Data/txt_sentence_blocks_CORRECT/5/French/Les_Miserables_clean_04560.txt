Gavroche 's bed stood as in a cage , behind this net . 
The whole resembled an Esquimaux tent . 
This trellis-work took the place of curtains . 
Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front , and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart . 
`` Down on all fours , brats ! ''
