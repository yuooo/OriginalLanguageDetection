We have seen that the country owed much to him ; the poor owed him everything ; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him . 
His workmen , in particular , adored him , and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity . 
When he was known to be rich , `` people in society '' bowed to him , and he received invitations in the town ; he was called , in town , Monsieur Madeleine ; his workmen and the children continued to call him Father Madeleine , and that was what was most adapted to make him smile . 
In proportion as he mounted , throve , invitations rained down upon him . 
`` Society '' claimed him for its own .
