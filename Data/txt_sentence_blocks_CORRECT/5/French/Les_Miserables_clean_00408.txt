Madame Magloire cleared the table very promptly . 
I understood that we must retire , in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep , and we both went up stairs . 
Nevertheless , I sent Madame Magloire down a moment later , to carry to the man 's bed a goat skin from the Black Forest , which was in my room . 
The nights are frigid , and that keeps one warm . 
It is a pity that this skin is old ; all the hair is falling out .
