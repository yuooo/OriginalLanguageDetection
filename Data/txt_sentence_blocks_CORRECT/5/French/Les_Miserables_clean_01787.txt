A word was sufficient for him , sometimes a sign ; the mastodon obeyed . 
Thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in Madame Thenardier 's eyes , though she did not thoroughly realize it . 
She was possessed of virtues after her own kind ; if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with `` Monsieur Thenardier , '' -- which was an inadmissible hypothesis , by the way , -- she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever . 
She would never have committed `` before strangers '' that mistake so often committed by women , and which is called in parliamentary language , `` exposing the crown . '' 
Although their concord had only evil as its result , there was contemplation in Madame Thenardier 's submission to her husband .
