Whenever you may be sad , Raoul , I feel that my heart will be dissolved in sadness ; and when you smile on thinking of me , be assured you will send me , from however remote a distance , a vital scintillation of your joy . '' 
`` I will not promise you to be joyous , '' replied the young man ; `` but you may be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you , not one hour , I swear , unless I shall be dead . '' 
Athos could contain himself no longer ; he threw his arm round the neck of his son , and held him embraced with all the power of his heart . 
The moon began to be now eclipsed by twilight ; a golden band surrounded the horizon , announcing the approach of the day . 
Athos threw his cloak over the shoulders of Raoul , and led him back to the city , where burdens and porters were already in motion , like a vast ant-hill .
