The moon , which had just risen behind her , cast Cosette 's shadow in front of her upon this lawn , as she came out from the shrubbery . 
Cosette halted in alarm . 
Beside her shadow , the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow , which was particularly startling and terrible , a shadow which had a round hat . 
It was the shadow of a man , who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery , a few paces in the rear of Cosette . 
She stood for a moment without the power to speak , or cry , or call , or stir , or turn her head .
