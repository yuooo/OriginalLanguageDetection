A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere , for making signals in the fogs . 
It was loaded to the muzzle ; but just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole , Mr. Fogg said , `` Hoist your flag ! '' 
The flag was run up at half-mast , and , this being the signal of distress , it was hoped that the American steamer , perceiving it , would change her course a little , so as to succour the pilot-boat . 
`` Fire ! '' 
said Mr. Fogg .
