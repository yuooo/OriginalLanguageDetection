If you are ruined , monsieur , look at the affair manfully , for you too , mordioux ! 
belong to posterity , and have no right to lessen yourself in any way . 
Stay a moment ; look at me , I who seem to exercise in some degree a kind of superiority over you , because I am arresting you ; fate , which distributes their different parts to the comedians of this world , accorded me a less agreeable and less advantageous part to fill than yours has been . 
I am one of those who think that the parts which kings and powerful nobles are called upon to act are infinitely of more worth than the parts of beggars or lackeys . 
It is far better on the stage - on the stage , I mean , of another theater than the theater of this world - it is far better to wear a fine coat and to talk a fine language , than to walk the boards shod with a pair of old shoes , or to get one 's backbone gently polished by a hearty dressing with a stick .
