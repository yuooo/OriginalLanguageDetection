The Bishop looked at him , and said , -- `` You have suffered much ? '' 
`` Oh , the red coat , the ball on the ankle , a plank to sleep on , heat , cold , toil , the convicts , the thrashings , the double chain for nothing , the cell for one word ; even sick and in bed , still the chain ! 
Dogs , dogs are happier ! 
Nineteen years ! 
I am forty-six .
