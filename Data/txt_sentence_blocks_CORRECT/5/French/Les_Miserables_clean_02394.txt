This logic was known to the ancients . 
The soothsayers practise it . 
They rubbed a black heifer over with chalk , and said , `` She is white , Bos cretatus . '' 
As for us , we respect the past here and there , and we spare it , above all , provided that it consents to be dead . 
If it insists on being alive , we attack it , and we try to kill it .
