The police discovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an ex-convict who had broken his ban , condemned in 1796 for theft , and named Jean Valjean . 
Jean Valjean has been recommitted to prison . 
It appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of M. Laffitte , a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there , and which he had , moreover , and by perfectly legitimate means , acquired in his business . 
No one has been able to discover where Jean Valjean has concealed this money since his return to prison at Toulon . 
The second article , which enters a little more into detail , is an extract from the Journal de Paris , of the same date .
