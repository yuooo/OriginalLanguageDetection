According to custom , the prisoner was without a light . 
At the hour of curfew , he was bound to extinguish his lamp , and we perceive how much he was favored , in being allowed to keep it burning even till then . 
Near the bed a large leathern armchair , with twisted legs , sustained his clothes . 
A little table - without pens , books , paper , or ink - stood neglected in sadness near the window ; while several plates , still unemptied , showed that the prisoner had scarcely touched his evening meal . 
Aramis saw that the young man was stretched upon his bed , his face half concealed by his arms .
